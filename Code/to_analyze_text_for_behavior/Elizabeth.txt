00:00:00 Speaker 1 This is I've done this and I'm ready to face it, but I would.
00:00:39 Speaker 2 Sorry about that.
00:00:40 Speaker 1 That's OK.
00:00:41 Speaker 2 Too many people moving and shake here and there and you can't really keep track of who's doing what.
00:00:46 Speaker 2 So. So yeah, like I said.00:00:50 Speaker 2 I'm just going to go through for everything in this room is audio and video recorded. First off, be OK with that. OK, so I just want to go through, like I said, a couple of formalities, cover a few little things off.
00:00:54 Speaker 1 Right. Oh yes.
00:01:00 Speaker 2 Things that I have to do on my end that I need to do and things that I just want to tell you and make sure that we're all on the same page before we before we get going. OK. So First off today is Wednesday, October the 5th, 2016. And on my phone right now, I'll just use that as a a time reference. It's 5/14.
00:01:09 Speaker 1 OK.
00:01:20 Speaker 2 So 1714, we'll just use that as a start time of our conversation here today. Again, my name is Nathan Hergott with the Woodstock police service. I currently work in.
00:01:28 Speaker 2 Our crime unit?
00:01:29 Speaker 2 OK. And we met a short time ago in downtown Toronto. Correct? Right. Yeah. So.
00:01:35 Speaker 2 We came to a facility where you've spent the last few weeks. From what I understand, and we met with Doctor Khan and his team of officiates and I believe you're under his care for the.
00:01:40 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:01:44 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:01:47 Speaker 2 Last little while, correct.
00:01:49 OK.
00:01:50 Speaker 2 And.
00:01:52 Speaker 2 The process how we got here basically is kind of offered you a ride back and and so we could have this conversation and and you gracefully accepted and.
00:02:03 Speaker 2 Off we went down the 401 or the the gardener view and we and and and here we are. Right. So just to make it clear for whoever may watch us in the future, we didn't force you to come with us. We didn't, you know, show you in the car and off we went kind of thing. You did it on your own.
00:02:06 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:02:07 Speaker 1 The Four 3 is.
00:02:19 Speaker 2 Free will and you accepted it on your own.
00:02:22 Speaker 2 On your own decision making, is that correct?
00:02:24 Speaker 1 Yep, I had a nap and even let me try to give money to.
00:02:27 Speaker 1 The homeless people.
00:02:28 Speaker 2 There you go. I remember all of that. I remember all of that. So I know I read you a few things before.
00:02:35 Speaker 2 As we were kind of just cruising down Spadina there and I know you've been read this many times, but it's just things that we need to just reiterate and make sure that you're clear and full with with having this conversation today. OK, like I said, based on our investigation, there could be some some pretty serious criminal charges that result.
00:02:44 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:02:55 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:02:55 Speaker 2 Of our investigation, OK. So having said that, if if you wish to speak to a lawyer at anytime.
00:02:57 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:03:02 Speaker 1 OK.
00:03:03 Speaker 2 I don't want you to hesitate.
00:03:05 Speaker 2 We can make it happen whenever you're like. So whether it's now 5 minutes from now, an hour from now, or three days from now, whatever.
00:03:12 Speaker 2 The case may be you didn't let.
00:03:13 Speaker 1 We're not going to be asking questions which retains our listening.
00:03:15 Speaker 2 I hope not, I hope.
00:03:17 Speaker 2 I'm the dude. I'm just saying that anytime that you want to speak to a lawyer that you're kind of in our company or whatever the case may be, you let us know and we can make that accommodation period. Does that make sense? OK, because you in your position as a Canadian citizen, you're you're entitled to have free legal advice.
00:03:28 Yes.
00:03:35 Speaker 2 Among the lead.
00:03:37 Speaker 2 Juice Council lawyer, the lawyer for Christ, whoever you like.
00:03:40 Speaker 1 OK, makes sense, yes.
00:03:43 Speaker 2 And like I said, because there could.
00:03:45 Speaker 2 Be.
00:03:46 Speaker 2 Some criminal charges that the results of our next generation also and I know you've been read this many times before, that you may be charged with many criminal offenses and and you don't have to say anything answer.
00:04:01 Speaker 2 To the charges that you paid.
00:04:03 Speaker 2 But if you wish to do so, we're going to do that today. But whatever you do say could be used in court, and I know we had that conversation in the car on the way on the way back to Woodstock. And I asked you to repeat it in your own words and you kind of gave us a few.
00:04:20 Speaker 2 A few of.
00:04:20 Speaker 2 Of describing it in your own vocabulary, as you said, something like is not Vegas. What happened in the car on the way back doesn't necessarily stay in the car, right? So same thing, same thing, this room, anything that you say and everything that we talked about should be evidence at court. OK, so kind of to put it easily the same rules of life, OK.
00:04:30 Speaker 1 OK.
00:04:33 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:04:39 Speaker 2 Uh.
00:04:41 Speaker 2 And if you've spoken to any other police officers, I know that you've dealt with the Toronto police officers. There was a couple officers in a car on our on our trip back here. If anyone persuaded you or tried to push you into making a statement, whatever they said. I don't want that to influence you in any way. OK. I want you to.
00:04:45 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:04:58 Speaker 1 Now what I'm about.
00:04:59 Speaker 1 Say.
00:04:59 Speaker 1 And I'm giving up.
00:05:01 OK.
00:05:03 Speaker 2 And I appreciate.
00:05:05 Speaker 2 And we'll get moving forward for another few things. And I know that we.
00:05:08 Right.
00:05:10 Speaker 2 Said this in the cart you are.
00:05:11 Speaker 2 Not under arrest.
00:05:12 Speaker 2 Right now. OK. OK. I want to make that very clear to you. OK? You're not under arrest. The door is unlocked. OK. I'm not repeating your wait. Or if you want to leave at any time. If you want to stop talking to me at any time, you just let me know.
00:05:26 Speaker 2 And then we'll just carry on from there, OK.
00:05:29 Speaker 2 But you're not being held here against your will. We're not forcing you to speak to us. We just have some follow up. Some some follow up questions from the investigation. That kind of got going while you're in Toronto.
00:05:40 Speaker 1 Yeah, being interviewed, it's hard because it takes so long. So I'll do my best. Like if, like I said, if I have to get up and pace around.
00:05:43 Speaker 2 It does.
00:05:48 Speaker 2 A bit or whatever you want to take a break at anytime you let us know if you want to go.
00:05:52 Speaker 2 And pace around.
00:05:53 Speaker 2 I'll just kind of hang tight here and we'll just keep conversing as long as long as you're comfortable.
00:05:54 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:05:58 Speaker 1 I have no as long as I can.
00:06:00 Speaker 2 All right, sounds good.
00:06:03 Speaker 2 That's kind of all formalities, but like I said, those are the things that I just wanted to make sure that we're.
00:06:08 Speaker 2 Here to you.
00:06:09 Speaker 2 And if you have any questions for.
00:06:10 Speaker 2 Me before we get started.
00:06:13 Speaker 2 The floor is yours using or any concerns.
00:06:14 Speaker 1 No, no, I didn't. I want to get through this and find out what happened to my mom and dad because I know they're upset because someone went to visit them today and she visited them today and they said, you know, they're here. We're concerned what's going on.
00:06:15 Speaker 2 That you have.
00:06:23 Speaker 2 OK.
00:06:29 Yeah.
00:06:30 Speaker 2 I can imagine.
00:06:32 Speaker 2 I can imagine that, and I honestly don't have those answers for you, but I can get them for you.
00:06:38 Speaker 2 My role in this investigation so far has been.
00:06:41 Speaker 2 Not as in depth as some of the other officers, but my my task today obviously was to travel to Toronto and be with you with with my fellow coworkers and and come back here and and have conversations. So that's kind of where where I'm at right now, but I can definitely get those answers for you. And and I don't want to upset.
00:06:43 Speaker 1 OK.
00:06:49 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:06:58 Speaker 2 Any more people that need to be?
00:07:02 Speaker 1 You should have bought boot boot your ticket.
00:07:04 Speaker 1 For you right there.
00:07:05 Speaker 2 You know what?
00:07:06 Speaker 2 If I could afford them for the last, I probably would have.
00:07:09 Speaker 2 Yeah, I was excited last night.
00:07:11 Speaker 2 UM.
00:07:14 Speaker 2 So just just for the record and I know you prefer to go by Beth as what you told me. Is that correct?
00:07:18 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:07:18 Speaker 2 Can you just state your full name for me?
00:07:20 Speaker 1 Elizabeth Tracy, may Wettlaufer.
00:07:22 Speaker 2 Tracy may. Yeah. OK. And just spell your last.
00:07:25 Speaker 1 Name the record TLAUSER.
00:07:31 Speaker 2 Invest the reason why we're here today is because we've received some information back at the end of last week.
00:07:39 Speaker 2 With regards to some information that was provided to the Toronto Police Service, which led us into quite a bit of work and leads us here today to speak to you with regards to kind of how this all started and and follow up, but basically.
00:07:53 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:07:56 Speaker 2 I've watched your statement that you provided to Trump, OK, and we've been provided.
00:08:03 Speaker 2 This document here.
00:08:04 Speaker 2 Does that look familiar to you?
00:08:05 Speaker 1 Yeah, that's right.
00:08:06 Speaker 2 All right. And from what I can see here, there's 4 pages of handwritten documents that you're handwriting.
00:08:13 Speaker 2 OK. And it just kind of goes through some people that you've encountered in your career from 2007 through to 2016 of August, August of 2016, OK, so, so that's kind of the the focus of our investigation right now is.
00:08:23 Speaker 1 2015.
00:08:32 Speaker 1 Right.
00:08:32 Speaker 2 The information that you've put on these four pieces.
00:08:35 Speaker 1 Of paper, yes.
00:08:35 Speaker 2 OK, but before we get into that, I just want to kind of get an idea of your career and.
00:08:41 Speaker 2 Where you kind of where you've been in your career and kind of how you got into things?
00:08:45 Speaker 1 And registered nurse I started I.
00:08:49 Speaker 1 Started from with from.
00:08:52 Speaker 1 Here in Park Secondary school I.
00:08:58 Question.
00:08:59 Speaker 1 I graduated grade 1313 year in law school, not law school. So a journalism school and.
00:09:09 Speaker 1 Then I went to Bible College and London Baptist Bible College in London, graduated with a degree in counseling with the bachelor's degree in counseling.
00:09:23 Speaker 1 And then.
00:09:25 Speaker 1 Discovered that that's not going to be wasn't really going to get me.
00:09:28 Speaker 1 A.
00:09:28 Speaker 1 Lot far as work wise and career wise. And so I went back to here in Park High School for a year.
00:09:39 Speaker 1 And I took a year of maths and sciences and went on to.
00:09:45 Speaker 1 Conestoga College in.
00:09:49 Speaker 1 They have it's in Kitchener, but they have staff for campus, so I.
00:09:52 Speaker 1 Went there for three years.
00:09:53 OK.
00:09:54 Speaker 1 And then when I graduated there.
00:09:57 Speaker 1 I worked in a place called Geraldton which is 16 hours Mason of Toronto, 3 hours north of Thunder Bay.
00:10:03 Speaker 2 Like I said, it's quite a bit north.
00:10:06 Speaker 2 Yeah, that's what's up there.
00:10:07 Speaker 1 Yes, work there.
00:10:10 Speaker 1 Couldn't stand the isolation, moved back, worked for an organization called the Christian Horizons here in town, and one of their group homes.
00:10:21 Speaker 1 Till 2007.
00:10:25 Speaker 1 At which time my marriage fell apart in February 2007, and I met a woman online and she decided to move to be with me. So I ended up.
00:10:42 Speaker 1 Quitting the job of that and going to corrective care to make a little bit more money because I would never burden burner. So I started working at Crescent Care.
00:10:54 Speaker 1 It was June.
00:10:55 Speaker 1 2007.
00:11:00 Speaker 2 And how long did you work there for?
00:11:02 Speaker 1 Until.
00:11:09 Speaker 1 Yeah, till like I.
00:11:11 Speaker 1 Think it's March 2014?
00:11:14 Speaker 2 And were you always in the same role or did you do different role of that dressing chair or?
00:11:16 Speaker 1 As the red as a registered nurse and registered nurses role is always the same. But.
00:11:25 Speaker 1 I worked in different areas of the home. There's five wings.
00:11:28 Speaker 2 OK.
00:11:31 Speaker 1 To correct some carrots, I worked in different.
00:11:33 Speaker 2 Areas right of the seven or so years that.
00:11:37 Speaker 2 You were there? Yeah.
00:11:38 Speaker 2 And at that point, did you have different supervisors from unit to unit or Jerry reported the same person or?
00:11:43 Speaker 1 No, there was. There was one supervisor, Helen Conway. She was ahead there.
00:11:50 Speaker 1 And then there was, like, people under her. Shelly Jeanette.
00:12:00 Speaker 1 Then there was like a an administrative head.
00:12:04 Speaker 1 I think for most of that time.
00:12:05 Speaker 1 It was Brenda.
00:12:08 Speaker 2 OK. And then from Chris, currently you've had a few other.
00:12:12 Speaker 1 Yeah, I went from Crescent Care fired from Crescent care, OK.
00:12:18 Speaker 1 For a medication area era error, then from there I went to Meadow Park nursing home.
00:12:26 Speaker 2 OK.
00:12:27 Speaker 1 And left there.
00:12:29 Speaker 1 Here to give help with an addiction issue health and that it would get help with that as well.
00:12:39 Speaker 1 And then when it came back, I started working again in January. I left.
00:12:45 Speaker 1 I left Meadow Park in September of 2014 and I started working for a.
00:12:54 Speaker 1 Nursing agency called Lifeguard in 2015.
00:13:00 Speaker 1 And I worked with them.
00:13:03 Speaker 1 For over a year, and then in July 2016, I started working for Saint Elizabeth Healthcare as well. I was still working for lifeguard.
00:13:17 Speaker 2 OK. And how did that work? Did you just split your time between the two or was it just kind of a part time position at both organizations?
00:13:26 Speaker 1 Saint Elizabeth was my priority. So, and lifeguard is very much. You pick up the shifts as they come. Very few scheduled shifts so.
00:13:36 Speaker 1 Get to know them and focus on family.
00:13:40 Speaker 2 And were those roles where you would do like in home care with different lines?
00:13:45 Speaker 1 With the lifeguard, it's an agency, so you go into nursing homes, you go into people's homes, you go into.
00:13:56 Speaker 1 You go into like retirement homes.
00:14:02 Speaker 1 We did a lot of different things, a lot.
00:14:03 Speaker 1 Of one on.
00:14:04 Speaker 1 Ones with.
00:14:04 Speaker 1 People like in their own.
00:14:06 Speaker 1 Homes.
00:14:07 Speaker 1 12 hour shifts, 8 hour shifts sitting with them, a lot of stuff I did with sitting with high.
00:14:13 Speaker 1 Just patient, right. OK.
00:14:16 Speaker 2 That would be tough.
00:14:18 Speaker 1 Hey, that's OK. Yeah. Like, because I knew they were going to die, and it was just an opportunity to give the family a.
00:14:25 Speaker 2 Rest. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. It's an important role. I mean, a lot of people wouldn't see it that way and wouldn't even notice the care that these people are giving. And from people like yourself. Right. So we give the families a bit of a break and.
00:14:37 Speaker 2 And take take take that role as.
00:14:40 Speaker 2 An important thing which a lot.
00:14:41 Speaker 2 Of people don't see right so.
00:14:42 Speaker 1 Since when some when someone buying the house families don't want everyone to be asleep at once, right? And that can be very hard if you're not able to do that. But if you have nurse there that says no, it's OK. I've got this. I know the medication to get.
00:14:50 Speaker 2 That's right.
00:14:59 Yeah.
00:15:02 Speaker 2 Back at Meadow Park.
00:15:04 Speaker 2 What was your addiction?
00:15:07 Speaker 1 Hi, mark.
00:15:12 Speaker 2 And what?
00:15:12 Speaker 2 Like how much were you using?
00:15:14 Speaker 1 I was a binge user so I would use what I could get a hold of by doing it from the patient.
00:15:22 Speaker 2 Right. And how would that work? Bigger than would it just be in their in their allotted medications or would you have access to a car to feed your?
00:15:29 Speaker 1 There's there's some. There's a lot of medication.
00:15:33 Speaker 1 Some of them had confusions, so they couldn't tell the difference between what those you were giving them like, given the large difference that item.
00:15:46 Speaker 1 There was a lot of the times as needed, so it would be in a.
00:15:50 Speaker 1 Big.
00:15:50 Speaker 1 Card and they say I would just punch out that. Ohh. Barney needed two of those today and I'll delete even three of those today when they really didn't. And that's how I was gonna hold of it every once in a while. There was also a.
00:16:07 Speaker 1 Drug, drug big drug holder.
00:16:11 Speaker 1 Like a safe. Almost that we would put the.
00:16:14 Speaker 1 Drugs in OK.
00:16:15 Speaker 1 Once, like if somebody dies and they're like 23 hydro marks left with sizable carbon colder. Well, if you pick it up and turn it upside down and shook it, you get drugs back out of it.
00:16:30 Speaker 2 They have your wages.
00:16:30 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:16:32 Speaker 2 And was that ever?
00:16:35 Speaker 2 An issue with with the other we ever confronted.
00:16:37 Speaker 2 Or that did that go totally undetected?
00:16:38 Speaker 1 I was.
00:16:40 Speaker 2 For the the time you're.
00:16:41 Speaker 1 There was a time when Hydromorph was delivered to the home.
00:16:48 Speaker 1 And it didn't get put away right away. But the person who should have. And so I took the hide remarks and put it in my bag and took it home. And it was who discovered her.
00:16:59 Speaker 1 And so I just played down.
00:17:02 Speaker 1 From the police home about it actually done, yeah.
00:17:07 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:17:09 Speaker 2 So as a binge binge user then, like how much would you would you be using on a I mean obviously when you on a daily basis are you have you been using but like how long did the addiction last for?
00:17:16 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:17:19 Speaker 1 Oh, the addiction lasted from being started in 2008 to 2000 and.
00:17:27 Speaker 1 14 at which time I went away and got treatment at a treatment center. But then I started using again.
00:17:36 Speaker 1 Probably since January 2015.
00:17:44 Speaker 1 No.
00:17:45 Speaker 1 No, and.
00:17:48 Speaker 1 I'm going to stop using alcohol as well. I'm going to I have friends in A and I'm I've got a very clear plan thing. If if I'm able to be out and vote or have a very clear plan. And I also know if I'm not able to be able.
00:18:02 Speaker 1 To vote that.
00:18:03 Speaker 1 A and their products and others didn't have some problems where they come into prison.
00:18:08 Speaker 1 No.
00:18:10 Speaker 1 That's my plan.
00:18:12 Speaker 2 That's good that you have a plan.
00:18:15 Speaker 2 What do you think?
00:18:16 Speaker 2 Do you think the reason is that you stepped into the addiction? That you know what the just the scrapping of the job that you're facing, they're dealing with your personal life as well?
00:18:21 Speaker 1 Yeah. Yeah, just.
00:18:24 Speaker 1 And just always feeling like I had to be the best possible person and very, very stressful job giving medications to 32 people and making sure.
00:18:35 Speaker 1 Treatments were done on 32 people carrying presents, 32 people supervising 4P studies, who sometimes didn't always get along and sometimes always didn't always get along with me.
00:18:49 Speaker 1 It's a hard job and in there it's a hard job and then they would add different things like oh, you have to do this and that to say who's here and counting the medications at the end of the shift. And it was a hard job. And I just, I always was putting this pressure on myself.
00:18:52 Speaker 2 I believe 100%.
00:19:07 Speaker 1 To be a really.
00:19:08 Speaker 1 Good nurse and to do everything.
00:19:09 Speaker 1 Perfectly. And every once in a while.
00:19:12 Speaker 1 When I give.
00:19:12 Speaker 1 The whole of the hydra marker to you and take it. Then that pressure was gone, right?
00:19:21 Speaker 2 And.
00:19:23 Speaker 2 Treatment center that you went away to lower down.
00:19:28 Speaker 1 I cannot remember. I've tried to try to remember.
00:19:34 Speaker 1 No, it was. It was at a town that was like.
00:19:36 Speaker 1 2.
00:19:37 Speaker 1 Was a 2 hour drive. No, I have a lock fire near 9. Well, it's a little town outside of Wayland.
00:19:42 Speaker 2 Well.
00:19:48 Speaker 1 And they have.
00:19:51 Speaker 1 It's an 18 day treatment that they have and I was successful. I went through the whole thing. So all 18 days, yeah, OK. And it helps. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:03 Speaker 2 What about family? You're born and raised with.
00:20:05 Speaker 1 Son. Yeah, born and raised. And what's not married?
00:20:09 Speaker 1 From 2000, from 97 to 2007.
00:20:14 Speaker 1 We broke up.
00:20:17 Speaker 1 February 2007 no children.
00:20:22 Speaker 1 I wanted them. They never did. My mom and dad are in their 70s.
00:20:27 Speaker 1 75 and 76.
00:20:31 Speaker 1 I have cousins all over the area and.
00:20:36 Speaker 1 My brother and his wife and four kids they live in.
00:20:42 Speaker 1 And they're.

00:21:09 Speaker 1 Thanks.
00:21:24 Speaker 1 They live with the fact.
00:21:26 Speaker 1 They went back.
00:21:28 Speaker 2 So your brother older or?
00:21:29 Speaker 1 Younger than you. Older, older. He's three years older than 52.
00:21:38 Speaker 2 UM.
00:21:40 Speaker 2 So as far as your latest position at Saint Elizabeth, that was your last position in the end. Is that correct? OK. And you said you resigned from there. Yeah. OK. What, what brought you to that?
00:21:41 Yeah.
00:21:44 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:21:47 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:21:47 Speaker 1 It was.
00:21:56 Speaker 1 That.
00:21:57 Speaker 1 Is that that's when things get a little crazy.
00:22:02 Speaker 1 The part that I haven't told the doctors.
00:22:09 Speaker 1 You're so stupid now.
00:22:14 Speaker 1 When my ex.
00:22:14 Speaker 1 And I broke up in 2007.
00:22:17 Speaker 1 I was already taking the medication for my my borderline personality disorder.
00:22:24 Speaker 1 And I was so angry.
00:22:28 Speaker 1 And it was like a voice said inside me. I'll use you.
00:22:31 Speaker 1 Don't worry about it.
00:22:34 Speaker 1 And.
00:22:36 Speaker 1 The different times that.
00:22:38 Speaker 1 I have caused people's deaths. They caused them discomfort through the through the insulin. I believe it was the influence of that voice or whatever it was. It was in the voice in my head. It was a voice in here. And when I would do it afterwards, I would hear like a lobster in my house.
00:22:58 Speaker 1 So started working for Saint Elizabeth.
00:23:02 Speaker 1 And I was doing well, but it was a lot of pressure and the way that you.
00:23:08 Speaker 1 Know that I've.
00:23:10 Speaker 1 Help people love to die has been through insulin.
00:23:14 Speaker 1 And after my first my 30 day.
00:23:18 Speaker 1 Evaluation. Liar.
00:23:22 Speaker 1 My supervisor came to me and said, you know, I'm really sorry.
00:23:27 Speaker 1 We want you for Woodstock but.
00:23:28 Speaker 1 We have so many.
00:23:29 Speaker 1 Cancers, schools and in your fall.
00:23:32 Speaker 1 That need help with their insulin pumps that you're going to?
00:23:35 Speaker 1 Start working in.
00:23:36 Speaker 1 In your school and I panicked.
00:23:41 Speaker 1 I panic. I didn't want to do that.
00:23:44 Speaker 1 So that you know what they're good, the kids. So about.
00:23:51 Speaker 1 This one little week after that that I quit.
00:23:55 Speaker 1 And then I packed my stuff in the car and I drove 2 days into. I drove into Quebec.
00:24:02 Speaker 1 Thinking like I would just.
00:24:04 Speaker 1 Start running away, sort of.
00:24:05 Speaker 1 Thing then I thought no, that's just stupid.
00:24:08 Speaker 1 I came back.
00:24:10 Speaker 1 And.
00:24:13 Speaker 1 That's going to tell my parents what was.
00:24:14 Speaker 1 Going on that they had.
00:24:15 Speaker 1 Visitors from Scotland, so I didn't tell them. I just.
00:24:22 Speaker 1 Sorry, Ben. Two weeks pretending to go to work.
00:24:28 Speaker 1 When we're here.
00:24:29 Speaker 2 Thanks.
00:24:29 Speaker 1 It's funny, but it's not funny.
00:24:32 Speaker 1 And then.
00:24:35 Speaker 1 Once I left, I decided I didn't want to nurse anymore. I didn't want to hurt anybody anymore, so I also cooked my other job.
00:24:46 Speaker 1 And then I decided.
00:24:49 Speaker 1 Well, whatever Friday that was that, like I did a lot of looking into how I could get help, but I realized I needed help with whatever this was because part of me had started to believe that it was the devil and part of me thought it might be God with the purpose through my.
00:25:05 Speaker 1 Life.
00:25:07 Speaker 1 And I know the doctor asked me those.
00:25:09 Speaker 1 Questions and didn't answer because I was so shamed.
00:25:12 Speaker 1 But I just.
00:25:15 Speaker 1 I didn't want this to keep going on, so I put both jobs.
00:25:21 Speaker 1 Look into where.
00:25:22 Speaker 1 I could get help. Doctor Fernando is my psychiatrist.
00:25:26 Speaker 1 And he's not a very nice man.
00:25:29 Speaker 1 So.
00:25:31 Speaker 1 I went on an online support group and was talking on to people on there and they were saying, you know, get some help.
00:25:39 Speaker 1 So then I started researching some site boards and stuff and I saw candy.
00:25:46 Speaker 1 And they're the only.
00:25:49 Speaker 1 Mental health facility in Ontario that has any State department.
00:25:54 OK.
00:25:55 Speaker 1 So I made a decision and I went. I went there on Friday morning. I took the train and off I went and before we went I told the.
00:26:05 Speaker 1 To Edge told St. People what was going on.
00:26:11 Speaker 1 My friend from any and.
00:26:16 Speaker 1 My friend.
00:26:19 Speaker 1 And told them what was going on and said yes, go and get help.
00:26:23 Speaker 1 And my friend drove me to the train station.
00:26:27 Speaker 2 And when you say you told them what was going on, did.
00:26:29 Speaker 2 You get into details of.
00:26:31 Speaker 1 I told them that I told them that I had been killing people and they all said yes. You better go get help and.
00:26:31 Speaker 2 Why you're going to seek help or?
00:26:44 Speaker 1 She's friend from.
00:26:46 Speaker 1 When I work with.
00:26:50 Speaker 1 Right.
00:26:51 Speaker 2 Watching.
00:26:56 Speaker 2 And she drove me to the train station on, you know, on that Friday morning the Woodstock train.
00:26:59 Speaker 1 On the.
00:26:59 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:27:01 Speaker 1 Station, yeah.
00:27:03 Speaker 2 And and then your friend.
00:27:06 Speaker 1 Is my cousin.
00:27:08 Speaker 2 OK.
00:27:11 Speaker 2 No, yours.
00:27:12 Speaker 1 Yeah, she lives in DC.
00:27:15 Speaker 2 And if you don't want to tell me, that's fine. Based on the reason why this person may or may not be a friend.
00:27:21 Speaker 2 But you're a.
00:27:22 Speaker 1 Friend, my friend. Yeah, OK. I can tell your first name, but otherwise it's confidentiality.
00:27:30 Speaker 2 And I don't want to dig into that.
00:27:34 Speaker 2 At this point, that's all along. So did you.
00:27:38 Speaker 2 Disclose the same thing.
00:27:40 Speaker 2 To all those three people.
00:27:41 Speaker 1 That I have been giving didn't say why.
00:27:44 Speaker 1 Because at that.
00:27:44 Speaker 1 Point. I felt so stupid.
00:27:49 Speaker 1 It just helps. So stupid.
00:27:53 Speaker 2 And and best to be honest with you, I admire your.
00:27:58 Speaker 2 The way that you're conducting yourself and and telling us and having this conversation with me, I thank you for that. And I'm not here to judge in any way. So I don't want you to know that. And I'm not a doctor. I know you spent a.
00:28:05 Speaker 1 I know.
00:28:08 Speaker 2 Lot of time at at.
00:28:09 Speaker 2 TMH the last three weeks, right. And I'm far.
00:28:12 Speaker 2 From a doctor, but I do.
00:28:14 Speaker 2 Appreciate you. You telling me the truth and and telling me.
00:28:18 Speaker 2 The way that these things happen and played out, yeah. And and I admire you for that.
00:28:23 Speaker 1 And it's, you know, it's been a while because I've been doing about like.
00:28:28 Speaker 1 Do I give the?
00:28:29 Speaker 1 Names of the people that I killed.
00:28:30 Speaker 2 Right.
00:28:32 Speaker 1 Because then here's eight families.
00:28:35 Speaker 1 They thought that their family member died peacefully and normally and they didn't. And what's that going to do to those families?
00:28:44 Speaker 1 And even up to going to going to the hospital, I decided I was just going to give the first name and my cousin said let's.
00:28:54 Speaker 1 They know what years you work there. If you don't tell them the exact name they're going to go in there and go over every single file and that's going to be even worse for the families there. So that she was the one to give me that advice to give the name.
00:29:09 Speaker 2 And.
00:29:10 Speaker 2 As far as.
00:29:11 Speaker 2 You know that have these people reach out to.
00:29:14 Speaker 2 The police agencies where they may reside.
00:29:16 Speaker 2 To to modify that you.
00:29:17 Speaker 2 Told them this. Or did you tell them in? Kind of.
00:29:18 Speaker 1 No.
00:29:19 Speaker 2 Confidence and keep that to help.
00:29:20 Speaker 1 I told them confidence and they said they promised me they wouldn't tell anyone, but basically the the compliance was if I didn't get help right then, they'll be on the phone the.
00:29:30 Speaker 2 Next day. So did you tell them that Thursday?
00:29:33 Speaker 1 I told them like I told them the night before I went.
00:29:37 Speaker 2 OK. So Thursday night? Yeah. Friday morning. Yeah.
00:29:43 Speaker 1 That's basically what they said was, you know, if you haven't gotten help Friday, then work on the police. We love you, but we're calling the police.
00:29:53 Speaker 2 Probably felt that they had an obligation, right?
00:29:55 Speaker 1 Yes, yes.
00:29:57 Speaker 2 Would be a moral obligation or or release.
00:29:59 Speaker 2 On right? Yeah.
00:30:02 Speaker 2 What medications are you on right now?
00:30:04 Speaker 1 I'm taking.
00:30:06 Speaker 1 Fluvoxamine, it's called luvox 200 milligrams. It's anti obsessional and then anti depressant. I'm taking 300 milligrams of Seroquel which is an anti sick of it and they up to that? When I was at Cambridge, which has really helped clear my thinking.
00:30:23 Speaker 2 OK.
00:30:26 Speaker 1 Good.
00:30:26 Speaker 1 And then I'm taking a couple of blood pressure medications and then I've got some.
00:30:31 Speaker 1 Lots of pains.
00:30:33 Speaker 1 For when I get really agitated.
00:30:35 Speaker 2 And.
00:30:37 Speaker 2 When we left the hospital you had taken, I believe, some advantage that right?
00:30:41 Speaker 1 I took 2 milligrams of Ativan when we left the hospital. Which was you guys know at the time 1:30 or something like.
00:30:44 Speaker 2 Right.
00:30:49 Speaker 2 That.
00:30:50 Speaker 1 Yeah. And I've had nothing since.
00:30:54 Speaker 2 And I know that the doctor doctor come provided with the prescription.
00:30:57 Speaker 1 Yeah. And he also gave me two lots of.
00:31:00 Speaker 1 Teams.
00:31:00 Speaker 2 Yeah.
00:31:01 Speaker 1 And was very.
00:31:04 Speaker 1 I am not to take them until all the interviews are over because they will start to interfere with my thinking. And then that's exactly.
00:31:13 Speaker 2 And you feel that you're of a clear sound mind right now conversing with me in this, in this room and everything that you're.
00:31:16 Speaker 1 Yes, I.
00:31:16 Speaker 1 Do.
00:31:18 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:31:20 Speaker 2 Telling me is is the truth.
00:31:22 Speaker 2 And the best that you can remember.
00:31:23 Speaker 1 Yes, yes.
00:31:28 Speaker 2 I could, I could appreciate where you're coming from as far as the work that you went through. Obviously I've never been a nurse. I've never worked in in the reversal that you that you did, but I.
00:31:38 Speaker 2 Could imagine how overwhelming.
00:31:39 Speaker 2 It was having a lot of responsibility, maybe not having the support of of the administration.
00:31:40 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:31:45 Speaker 2 For your supervisors.
00:31:47 Speaker 2 You know, just kind of go out and get it done right. And and that could be I could see how that would be stressful and I could see how that would drive you maybe into your addiction into other things, but.
00:31:49 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:32:00 Speaker 2 I want to just go over this document if that's OK with you. OK. Would you be able to do that with me? OK. And you? You you do your thing. No, no. Don't be sorry. Absolutely not.
00:32:04 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah.
00:32:13 Speaker 1 This is pretty.
00:32:15 Speaker 1 Major, I've only ever had parking tickets.
00:32:18 Speaker 1 I've never been arrested.
00:32:19 Speaker 1 Anything is.
00:32:20 Speaker 2 While legend did not under record town, but it is, it is a very significant investigation ranging.
00:32:25 Speaker 1 I understand.
00:32:27 Speaker 2 And like I said before, Beth, I do appreciate you speaking with us and.
00:32:34 Speaker 2 You can imagine that that.
00:32:36 Speaker 2 Doesn't feel like a way off your.
00:32:37 Speaker 1 Shoulders. Yes, yes, yes.
00:32:38 Speaker 2 You've been carrying a burden for quite some time.
00:32:40 Speaker 1 And I've tried to get help.
00:32:43 Speaker 2 Well.
00:32:44 Speaker 2 Sometimes it takes a few attempts to.
00:32:47 Speaker 2 Finally, commit to it, right?
00:32:48 Speaker 1 Yeah, I had a pastor that.
00:32:49 Speaker 1 I told me, prayed over me and told me.
00:32:51 Speaker 1 I'd.
00:32:51 Speaker 1 Be fine. And that was God's grace. And then.
00:32:54 Speaker 2 When was that?
00:32:55 Speaker 1 That was Halloween 2000 and.
00:33:02 Speaker 1 13.
00:33:04 Speaker 1 Yeah.

00:33:13 Speaker 1 That was here in town. Do you want his name?
00:33:29 Speaker 1 I'm not sorry it wasn't.
00:33:32 Speaker 1 Could I just say 2014?
00:33:37 Speaker 1 With 2013.
00:33:41 Speaker 1 All right.
00:33:42 Speaker 2 So, so before we get into this, I know that there's a statement which we have and that I've watched where you attended the police station in Toronto that.
00:33:49 Speaker 2 52 Division is that.
00:33:50 Speaker 2 Correct. OK. And I honestly I think it.
00:33:51 Speaker 1 Yes.

00:33:56 Speaker 2 Other than check his name and I don't server with an A and you met with him for I was going to say about an.
00:34:03 Speaker 2 Hour and a half.
00:34:03 Speaker 1 That was not.
00:34:05 Speaker 2 And at that point.
00:34:07 Speaker 2 You had your possession a.
00:34:10 Speaker 2 Photocopy of this document, right.
00:34:11 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:34:12 Speaker 2 And you went through and you.
00:34:13 Speaker 2 Read it out.
00:34:14 Speaker 2 Yes, OK. And.
00:34:15 Speaker 2 Then following that, they started with the first name on the list and they wanted to just try and get a little bit more detail of of of the involvement in each circumstance in each death, right?
00:34:25 Speaker 1 OK, OK.
00:34:28 Speaker 2 That's what I'd like to do today and.
00:34:30 Speaker 2 Just give some more.
00:34:30 Speaker 2 Details. OK OK. So.
00:34:34 Speaker 1 Long list.

00:36:06 Speaker 2 You to recall.
00:36:06 Speaker 2 Some things, yeah. I'm just going to keep it here because, I mean, you've already written this out. So what's on here is we already know that I just had some follow up questions with regards to each circumstance. So, Mr. Silcock, it says here you were working at.
00:36:12 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:36:17 Speaker 1 OK.

00:36:37 Speaker 2 Shift with him.
00:36:38 Speaker 1 I didn't see him every time. He wasn't always my patient. I just knew from what people had said that he would grab the the nurses, the grass and bought FedEx and.
00:36:49 Speaker 1 He would say horribly and.
00:36:51 Speaker 1 Few things about his life, but now he was there, you know, he was going to suck all this. She was going to **** all with stuff because this would say different things and it just touched me inappropriately once.
00:37:03 Speaker 2 And where was that on your body and your breasts? OK. And were you alone in the room on that one?
00:37:04 Speaker 1 I'm over.
00:37:08 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:37:10 Speaker 2 Did he have a roommate at all? Did Jim have a roommate?
00:37:12 Speaker 1 I I he must have. He wasn't necessarily over. So he was either in a double robber quadruple.
00:37:20 Speaker 2 Would you remember any other residents that would?
00:37:21 Speaker 2 Be ruined within at that time, no.
00:37:25 Speaker 2 What portion of the home?
00:37:27 Speaker 2 Was James in at this point?
00:37:28 Speaker 1 He was in the Hidden E Wind S Wind north wind. He was in the north wind, looked halfway down, and he was either in a double bed.
00:37:38 Speaker 1 Or quadruple bud.
00:37:42 Speaker 2 And.
00:37:45 Speaker 2 The the diagnosis of of his health and at the time he were caring for him, you remember.
00:37:50 Speaker 1 He was both his surgery and he had dementia.
00:37:55 Speaker 2 Do you remember how old he was approximately?
00:37:56 Speaker 1 No, I don't have anything to say. Yeah.
00:37:59 Speaker 2 And the.
00:38:01 Speaker 2 And sorry, he was not a diabetic and sorry you said he had dementia, OK, which you've also noted here as well. Right. OK, so tell me about the night. Was it the first person that you did this to?
00:38:05 Speaker 1 Non.
00:38:05 Speaker 1 Diabetic.
00:38:08 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:38:10 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:38:16 Speaker 1 That I that I tried. Well, there were other people that done it too, who didn't die.
00:38:21 Speaker 2 Prior to James, they documented on here.
00:38:23 Speaker 1 Charging him personally, who died, right?
00:38:28 Speaker 1 Back here, people's agenda.
00:38:29 Speaker 2 But there's some other.
00:38:31 Speaker 2 Right, so I can't read that first.
00:38:33 Speaker 2 Name I'm Buddhist.
00:38:33 Speaker 1 Clotilde Adriana.
00:38:34 Speaker 2 OK, so that was, I mean, they're both September 2007, but that was before James.
00:38:36 Speaker 1 We.
00:38:37 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah.
00:38:39 OK.
00:38:40 OK.
00:38:40 Speaker 2 So was this your?
00:38:42 Speaker 2 First attempt at overdosing these people on insulin.
00:38:45 Speaker 1 Yes, and I didn't really want her to die. I just. I don't know.
00:38:51 Speaker 1 I was just.
00:38:52 Speaker 1 Angry and.
00:38:55 Speaker 1 Had this sense inside me.
00:38:57 Speaker 1 That she may be the person that God wanted.
00:38:59 Speaker 1 Back with him.
00:39:00 Speaker 2 And is that that feeling you're referring to that you had in your comic that science is that? Is that the point? And I need to get off to the topic here. But the point where you had these feelings in your stomach and almost that laughter after it happened, yeah, is.
00:39:02 Speaker 1 Yes. Yeah.
00:39:11 Speaker 2 That the part that you didn't tell Doctor Khan? Yeah.
00:39:13 Speaker 2 OK.
00:39:14 Speaker 2 I just want to be clear.
00:39:16 Speaker 1 I told him about the last year methodic, but not the feeling that this might be the person that God wants.
00:39:26 Speaker 2 It's your feelings, right?
00:39:30 Speaker 1 I honestly felt like God wanted to use me.
00:39:32 Speaker 1 And he kept Doctor Khan.
00:39:34 Speaker 1 Kept asking me if you can go to building for a special purpose.
00:39:37 Speaker 1 I can say no if that is not that.
00:39:41 Speaker 1 Yeah. So, but yeah, I just had a sense after my marriage broke up that God has been used me for something. And then after a while, I started to really wonder, after some of the murders, think it was God, or if it was the devil fooling me.
00:39:58 Speaker 2 Did you feel like you're doing the right thing for these people?
00:40:00 Speaker 1 No.
00:40:02 Speaker 1 No.
00:40:03 Speaker 1 I felt like I was doing what I was supposed to do, but it wasn't what was right for them.
00:40:12 Speaker 2 So James and it was in the evening that this one took place, right? Yeah.
00:40:21 Speaker 2 It says here at about 9:30.
00:40:22 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:40:23 Speaker 2 Running through.
00:40:25 Speaker 1 About 9:30 I gave him a dose of 50 milligrams of insulin. Not not diabetic.
00:40:25 Speaker 2 Portion of things.
00:40:32 Speaker 1 So I went into. I used a borrowed insulin pen and borrowed insulin.
00:40:37 Speaker 1 And gave him his one shot, and at 3:30 the TSA. Well, throughout the night he was yelling out. I love you. And I'm sorry not to not to me, but just you could hear him falling out in this room and that's what he was falling out.
00:40:50 Speaker 1 And then the 3:30 the TSA's came to me and said that he was gone.
00:40:56 Speaker 1 So.
00:40:58 Speaker 1 I did what we're supposed to do. I went listening to his heart and chest.
00:41:02 Speaker 1 Called the doctor, called the family. So that's what they wanted. Family came in. If that was them for a while.
00:41:09 Speaker 1 Doctor came in and said that his cause of death was from an embolism due to his post hip.
00:41:19 Speaker 1 He had he had hip surgery, doctoral, the level of hip surgery.
00:41:20 Speaker 2 Rich.
00:41:27 Speaker 2 Who do you think he was talking to when he?
00:41:29 Speaker 1 Was young. I love you. I thought it might be his family.
00:41:34 Speaker 1 They really did. And when they came in and talked to me, they wanted to know if he said anything.
00:41:38 Speaker 2 So I told them that I was so ashamed, so ashamed. You're speaking with family. And is that the the family? That kind of commended you for the work that you had done and and how much they appreciate with them?
00:41:44 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:41:50 Speaker 1 Yes, I've been there for, yes.
00:41:54 Speaker 2 Does that make you feel absolutely awful?
00:41:55 Awful.
00:41:58 Speaker 2 How did you deal with it?
00:42:01 Speaker 1 I just want how much better.
00:42:03 Speaker 1 You know, I felt awful. Maybe I fought with my girlfriend.
00:42:07 Speaker 1 Did some exercising. You know, there's some using the computer and just try to forget about it.
00:42:13 Speaker 2 Did your housing have a problem sleeping at night or anything like that, or did you?
00:42:17 Speaker 1 Well, I was working tonight, so I was on the.
00:42:20 Speaker 2 Very good during the day then.
00:42:23 Speaker 1 I would say.
00:42:24 Speaker 1 I've talked, been turned a bit. Yeah.
00:42:27 Speaker 1 Sounds pretty bad.
00:42:30 Speaker 1 And I just want to see the family again.
00:42:33 Speaker 1 So I tried to make sure I wasn't working when I came to pick up.
00:42:36 Speaker 1 The stuff and.
00:42:38 Speaker 2 And what room do you remember? Like a room number or just?
00:42:41 Speaker 2 Like you said that the wing? Yeah.
00:42:41 Speaker 1 No, it was down on our phone.
00:42:45 Speaker 2 When you were to treat the insulin from for James, for Mr. Silcox, you said you've taken some insulin and he's wherever to give us.
00:42:51 Speaker 1 And.
00:42:53 Speaker 1 The insulin was kept in a fridge in the medication room. We had two medication rooms.
00:42:59 Speaker 1 And some discussed in the fridge in the medication room.
00:43:02 Speaker 1 And the extra pens are kept in the drawer.
00:43:06 Speaker 1 So you could just say somebody even had someone admitted you needed a pen. Hurry.
00:43:11 Speaker 1 They just put it under the pen and.
00:43:14 Speaker 1 Put the needle on and dial up.
00:43:16 Speaker 1 The dose and give it.
00:43:17 Speaker 2 And how was that documented to know that so that Crescent care would know?
00:43:21 Speaker 2 That you were taking that?
00:43:23 Speaker 1 They didn't keep track of him.
00:43:26 Speaker 2 So just something that was available for the nurses.
00:43:29 Speaker 2 Use when they.
00:43:30 Speaker 2 Knew that was appropriate for the certifications.
00:43:32 Speaker 1 Yes. Now each patient has their own insulin, right? And maybe somebody noticed somebody may have noticed that a lot of insulin was missing and a lot was used. But I was always careful to using different people.
00:43:46 Speaker 2 Different people, yes. OK.
00:43:47 Speaker 1 And.
00:43:50 Speaker 2 And Mr. silcox? And where, where did you inject the?
00:43:52 Speaker 2 Insulin into his body.
00:43:56 Speaker 1 I'm not really sure I'm going to say his.
00:43:57 Speaker 1 Arm or his parts of.
00:44:01 Speaker 2 And did you know what was?
00:44:02 Speaker 2 Going on at that point, really.
00:44:03 Speaker 1 No.
00:44:04 Speaker 2 Was he? Was he a verbal?
00:44:06 Speaker 2 Patient like, could he converse with you and communicate?
00:44:07 Speaker 1 Oh yeah, he didn't really converse.
00:44:09 Speaker 1 Team did a lot of yelling at.
00:44:12 Speaker 1 Don't really remember him reacting when I gave it.
00:44:15 Speaker 2 So he didn't react.
00:44:17 Speaker 1 I don't remember reacting now.
00:44:20 Speaker 2 Would he maybe just think it's a regular portion of his day receiving medications that he he so required?
00:44:23 Probably.
00:44:26 Speaker 1 I would like.
00:44:28 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:44:34 Speaker 2 Is there anything else you can remember, Mr. Silcox?
00:44:38 Speaker 1 His wife and daughter loves him a lot.
00:44:43 Speaker 2 And I would like to give you crappy yeah.
00:44:51 Speaker 1 He.
00:44:54 Speaker 1 Yeah, like I said, it could be a bit of a handful, but you know, he ate and drank normally took his pills when he told him to. So nothing else. I can really remember about him, but this is, you know, nine years ago. Yeah.
00:45:08 Speaker 2 So.
00:45:14 Speaker 2 How long after? Sorry. When did you break up with?
00:45:15 Speaker 2 Your your husband like this.
00:45:17 Speaker 1 I broke up with him.
00:45:17 Speaker 2 In August 22nd, 2007.
00:45:20 Speaker 1 Oh, no, no. I woke up with him in.
00:45:23 Speaker 1 End of January beginning.
00:45:25 Speaker 1 Of February 2007.
00:45:27 Speaker 2 OK, so it was quite some time until September until you actually all right.
00:45:30 Speaker 1 Yeah, by that time I was in a new relationship.
00:45:33 Speaker 1 With a woman.
00:45:36 Speaker 1 Her name was Maureen.
00:45:43 Speaker 2 Did you ever expose her what you were doing?
00:45:45 Speaker 1 No, absolutely no.
00:45:48 Speaker 2 So you just kind of went about your thing with Mr. Silcox went home net.
00:45:52 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:45:54 Speaker 2 They did. You have some exercise in computer games which did you work again that next day?
00:45:58 Speaker 1 I don't know.
00:46:00 Speaker 2 Do you remember who you have been?
00:46:01 Speaker 2 Working with on that occasion.
00:46:05 Speaker 1 No, no, no, I don't. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I just do a lot of.
00:46:07 Speaker 2 Are you OK, stretch?
00:46:11 Speaker 2 OK. That's OK. Hey, you're not bothering me. I just want to make.
00:46:14 Speaker 2 Sure you're comfortable. OK, I need something else.
00:46:15 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:46:19 Speaker 2 That's right.
00:46:21 Speaker 2 Do you remember who?
00:46:22 Speaker 2 Your supervisor would be at that point.
00:46:24 Speaker 1 Well, that would be Helen Romney.
00:46:25 Speaker 2 That was the head nurse.
00:46:27 Speaker 1 She was always like whoever was on as the.
00:46:30 Speaker 1 Nurse was the charge nurse.
00:46:32 Speaker 1 So I was the charge nurse.
00:46:35 Speaker 1 And at night, so as the charge nurse from 3:00 to 11:00, I was in charge of.
00:46:44 Speaker 1 12345678 TSW and I would never.
00:46:52 Speaker 1 Yeah. And then.
00:46:55 Speaker 1 There was two other wings, and so at night, as the church nurse, I was responsible to look after the RPM on the other side like view resource server.
00:47:08 Speaker 1 There were four PSW's on that side and four PSI's on my side. The nine people, and then finally, of course, she wasn't around. Maybe the chief.
00:47:26 Speaker 1 Her and the executive director, Brenda.
00:47:35 Speaker 1 I'm sorry. I'm probably gonna.
00:47:40 Speaker 2 So as far as Mr. Silcox goes, then?
00:47:45 Speaker 2 Decides what you're feeling in your stomach.
00:47:47 Speaker 2 And besides that, you.
00:47:48 Speaker 2 Thought that this was the purpose that you.
00:47:50 Speaker 2 Were.
00:47:50 Speaker 2 Given on from your relationship forward after breaking up with your husband right, that you that you.
00:47:56 Speaker 2 He you indicated that he wasn't a very nice man.
00:47:59 Speaker 1 No.
00:48:00 Speaker 2 Is that?
00:48:01 Speaker 2 A portion of what happens.
00:48:03 Speaker 1 I don't know.
00:48:05 Speaker 1 I wonder if that's a portion of how I chose him afterwards. I did feel a release and a release.
00:48:11 Speaker 1 Like a release of pressure.
00:48:13 Speaker 2 Because throughout this document and as we go through.
00:48:16 Speaker 2 It a lot of these people.
00:48:19 Speaker 2 You kind of described them as not very nice people. Yeah, right. Yeah. So I'm not sure if that's a tendency or a pattern that we see as far as. Is that why you told these people?
00:48:29 Speaker 1 Yeah, I'm not. It might be, but I also know I just felt like they were the ones right. They just feeling as though that.
00:48:35 Speaker 1 They were.
00:48:36 Speaker 2 The one before before you.
00:48:39 Speaker 2 Injected insulin in Mr. Silcox.
00:48:43 Speaker 2 Was it a spur of the moment thing had?
00:48:45 Speaker 2 You thought about it that when?
00:48:46 Speaker 2 You reported for duty at.
00:48:47 Speaker 1 3:00 in the afternoon, thinking about it, about 6:00 at night, I think.
00:48:59 Speaker 2 And do you remember who the pronouncing Dr. would have been?
00:49:02 No.
00:49:02 No.
00:49:02 Speaker 2 Like how does how does.
00:49:03 Speaker 1 That process work process the way it works was person sound with no vital signs. Nurse goes in with the stethoscope. This is for one minute.
00:49:13 Speaker 1 If there's no heartbeat, no lung sounds. Nurse goes and calls the doctor on call.
00:49:19 Speaker 1 U.
00:49:19 Speaker 1 M.
00:49:21 Speaker 1 There was also a sheet that we had to fill out.
00:49:23 Speaker 1 If we thought it was a coroner's case.
00:49:26 Speaker 1 In this case, I don't believe we thought it was.
00:49:29 Speaker 1 And then.
00:49:31 Speaker 1 Family is called and the Doctor May wait to come in and pronounce in the morning. Family can come in and visit the body at anytime, so then the PSW's would get the the body ready.
00:49:44 Speaker 2 OK. So prior to the doctor announce you in the morning, the family could come in and even sign.
00:49:47 Speaker 1 Yeah. Yeah. So the PSW will just clean them up, put on, you know, clean britches and clean up the.
00:49:55 Speaker 1 Bed and stuff.
00:49:57 Speaker 2 So you said you said, Mr. Silcox, you said we didn't think it was a coroner's case.
00:50:02 Speaker 2 Who wanted that thing?
00:50:06 Speaker 2 OK.
00:50:07 Speaker 2 So would that be just a decision that?
00:50:10 Speaker 2 You are trusting to me.00:50:11 Speaker 1 A. No, there's a there's a form on the computer and you go down through and if it says if you take off anything that says yes.00:50:20 Speaker 1 You notify the coroner.00:50:22 Speaker 2 All right, but you would have clicked off those boxes yourself. Yes. OK. So obviously, knowing that you had done this to Mr. Silcox, did you feel that you wouldn't click? Yes. So that attention would be.00:50:33 Speaker 2 Drawn to you?00:50:34 Speaker 1 You know, I honestly can't.00:50:35 Speaker 1 Remember, if he was clever case or not.00:50:38 Speaker 1 You might have them.00:50:39 Speaker 2 Now with insulin.00:50:40 Speaker 1 I would even though I did this to these people when.00:50:43 Speaker 1 I did there.00:50:45 Speaker 1 But see, it's phrased as. Does anyone have a?00:50:49 Speaker 1 Reason to believe?00:50:50 Speaker 1 That this death was not natural, so yeah.00:50:54 Speaker 1 I would click.00:50:55 Speaker 1 I wouldn't get that one. Yeah, you're right.00:50:58 Speaker 2 OK. And I just wanted to clarify that please.00:51:02 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:51:06 Speaker 2 OK.00:51:09 Speaker 2 Anything else you can think about from R silcox?00:51:14 Speaker 2 Maurice.00:51:17 Speaker 2 Is it that?00:51:19 Speaker 2 So tell me a little bit about Maurice. This says that this occurred in September or October of.00:51:23 Speaker 2 20.00:51:25 2007.00:51:27 Speaker 2 And this was at present.00:51:27 Yes.00:51:28 Speaker 2 Care.00:51:29 Speaker 2 OK, tell me.00:51:29 Speaker 2 A little bit about your interactions with Maurice.00:51:31 Speaker 1 He was another one who'd like to grab restenosis. He was sometimes a patient of mine. See, at that time I wasn't. I didn't have a set for that. I worked on. I worked on all the different floors of the nurse guide was filling in.00:51:45 Speaker 1 So.00:51:49 Speaker 1 He.00:51:51 Speaker 1 One afternoon I was working with him and he.00:51:53 Speaker 1 Did grab me.00:51:54 Speaker 1 And again, I got that feeling inside that this is his time to go.00:52:00 Speaker 1 So I gave him an overdose of insulin after supper, and I believe he died the next day.00:52:07 Speaker 2 And what was your shift that do you remember what shift you working at that point?00:52:09 Speaker 1 It was 3:00 to 11:00.00:52:11 Speaker 2 3:00 PM.00:52:14 Speaker 2 11 year.00:52:14 Speaker 1 So did I. Lee died when I wasn't there.00:52:21 Speaker 2 He was known for it's that you're grabbing this dash breasts and *****.00:52:26 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:52:28 Speaker 2 And do you remember who you would been working with at that point?00:52:31 Speaker 2 Yeah. Do you remember where Maurice was within Crescent care?00:52:37 Speaker 1 Yeah, he was down in the north wing.00:52:40 Speaker 1 I think he was in a in a double room on.00:52:43 Speaker 1 The right hand side.00:52:45 Speaker 2 And you remember whose roommates were done at all?00:52:46 Speaker 1 And then.00:52:48 Speaker 1 No, I don't. But I do remember that when we started going downhill after the insulin overdose.00:52:53 Speaker 1 They moved into the palliative care room right by the nurses.00:53:00 Speaker 2 And at what point of the day do you?00:53:02 Speaker 2 Think that you sorry.00:53:03 Speaker 2 I think you said that. Sorry, but just.00:53:05 Speaker 2 To confirm what what time the.00:53:06 Speaker 2 ADP was when you had injected them with you.00:53:08 Speaker 1 And then injection.00:53:11 Speaker 1 It is afternoon evening 43530.00:53:16 Speaker 2 And and what was his reaction to her?00:53:20 Speaker 1 Again, it was just kind of like, oh, OK.00:53:23 Speaker 1 And it says the doctor wants you to have a vitamin shot.00:53:26 Speaker 1 That's what I usually say.00:53:28 Speaker 2 And was he able to communicate with you? Global could converse.00:53:31 Speaker 1 Is use verbal.00:53:34 Speaker 1 Not totally, but he could say something.00:53:38 Speaker 2 And did he question this vitamin travel?00:53:41 Speaker 1 No.00:53:43 Speaker 2 UM.00:53:46 Speaker 2 And he passed away the next day. Yeah. OK. So being that you weren't there when you passed away, you would have been the one.00:53:53 Speaker 2 Checking the boxes, that's.00:53:55 Speaker 1 Right.00:53:55 Speaker 2 So you know.00:53:58 Speaker 2 By chance, what nurse would have been responsible for?00:54:06 Speaker 2 Did you ever have any concerns that he didn't pass away while you were working and that?00:54:12 Speaker 2 You know, position may arise.00:54:14 Speaker 1 No.00:54:14 Speaker 1 I know I didn't. Well, yes, I did a little bit. I always wondered if they find the site where I gave the shot and.00:54:22 Speaker 1 Something you know, they've they've been an.00:54:25 Speaker 1 Investigation. I always wondered that.00:54:30 Speaker 2 And even though.00:54:30 Speaker 2 It passed through your mind. Did you just?00:54:33 Speaker 2 And yeah, and you remember what part of the body he would have been injected in?00:54:33 Speaker 2 Down about your.
00:54:41 Speaker 1 I need to make.00:54:44 Speaker 1 Because at that point he didn't have a lot of body fat, so he didn't know. And when you were a subcutaneous injection, it goes in to the body part. So.00:54:48 Speaker 2 Morriston.00:54:55 Speaker 2 And you've documented that.00:54:56 Speaker 2 He was a cancer patient. You know what type of cancer you had.00:54:58 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:55:00 Speaker 1 I think it was.00:55:05 Speaker 2 And what was the what the deal come to hold for his future as far as the cancer in his body? How do?00:55:10 Speaker 1 He was.00:55:12 Speaker 2 You think this?00:55:12 Speaker 1 Was 7576.
00:55:19 Speaker 2 I'm sorry. You in the double room?00:55:21 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:55:24 Speaker 2 During the work, we really been working with that day, same supervisor, nurse.00:55:30 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:55:32 Speaker 1 Sorry, I think it's so far yeah.00:55:33 Speaker 2 That's OK. It's a long time ago. I mean, obviously it's a significant event in life, but it's.00:55:40 Speaker 2 A long time ago.00:55:41 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:55:41 Speaker 2 So no, I'm not. I don't. I'm not concerned. You can't remember every question that I asked you. That's.00:55:46 Speaker 2 If you can do the best.
00:55:47 Speaker 2 That you can, that's all I.
00:55:49 Speaker 2 Can ask for OK.
00:55:49 Speaker 1 OK.
00:00:00 Speaker 1 I tried to stay away from it sometimes I was very interested to see what was happening. I would just try to stay away from it.
00:00:10 Speaker 2 Anything else you can remember about Maurice at all? Not really.
00:00:15 Speaker 1 You know, there were people who loved him. There were people who loved them.
00:00:16 Speaker 2 You will hear the corners gates.00:00:23 Speaker 2 Who loved Maurice? Who did?
00:00:24 Speaker 2 You know that.
00:00:25 Speaker 1 He had he had friends that were coming, that were like family.
00:00:25 Speaker 2 Would come visit him.
00:00:30 Speaker 1 And then the woman says.
00:00:35 Speaker 2 And how would it make?
00:00:35 Speaker 2 You feel when, when there's passed away.
00:00:37 Speaker 2 Not that what happened.
00:00:43 Speaker 1 I just. Well, I wasn't there when he passed away. I didn't work that day.
00:00:49 Speaker 2 Do you remember if you work the next thing?
00:00:52 Speaker 1 I might have. I know when I found out that he died, I'd love to see how long it took him to figure out the notes and stuff to see what I've got. And it's.
00:01:00 Speaker 1 Getting a point out to fetch it with.
00:01:01 Speaker 2 Yeah, no fun. Whatever you need.
00:01:06 Speaker 2 So after you found out you had passed you.
00:01:07 Speaker 2 Kind of read through the documents and.
00:01:09 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:01:10 Speaker 2 Do you remember seeing anything that kind of said? Oh, oh, you know.
00:01:13 Speaker 1 No.
00:01:14 Speaker 2 This isn't a good thing for the year.
00:01:15 Speaker 1 No.
00:01:16 Speaker 1 So and even if I had, I've been ultra sensitive, could not.
00:01:20 Speaker 2 You could have or.
00:01:20 Speaker 2 You OK?
00:01:26 Speaker 2 The next person on your list is Helen Matheson. Yeah. OK. So you go from September or October to 07. Yeah. And then Helen was 2011. Yeah. What, what happened between those years?
00:01:36 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:01:39 Speaker 1 I think you'll see the.
00:01:41 Speaker 2 Was there some comments?
00:01:46 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:01:48 Speaker 2 OK. And we'll.
00:01:49 Speaker 2 Get to those soon. Yeah. OK.
00:01:52 Speaker 1 How long? I don't remember a lot about. She was very quiet, very determined, just seemed to be waiting to die again. I had that feeling that, you know, this is.
00:02:02 Speaker 1 The one.
00:02:03 Speaker 1 And.
00:02:06 Speaker 1 I made a bit of a fuss about it that night because she was very lucid and we talked about how much she likes blue. Very.
00:02:13 Speaker 1 High in ice cream.
00:02:15 Speaker 1 So on my on my break I went to Walmart, I got a small blueberry pie and ice cream and brought it to her and she had.
00:02:23 Speaker 1 3 or 4.
00:02:23 Speaker 1 Like and then that night I overdosed her.
00:02:28 Speaker 1 Like I said, I had that feeling that.
00:02:31 Speaker 1 Great time to go and.
00:02:33 Speaker 2 With any valid issues towards the end of her life at that point.
00:02:36 Speaker 1 Know that she was the person to go.
00:02:39 Speaker 2 And that was.
00:02:41 Speaker 2 In your mind, in your stomach, where was that feeling?
00:02:41 Speaker 1 Give us.
00:02:43 Speaker 1 Darian after I did it, I got that lobster.
00:02:47 Speaker 2 When would you feel that laughter? Would you feel it right after you injected it or?
00:02:51 Speaker 2 Once the person passed away.
00:02:53 Speaker 1 Both.
00:02:55 Speaker 1 Oh.
00:02:58 Speaker 2 And Helen was you.
00:03:00 Speaker 2 Figure that she wasn't a diabetic.
00:03:02 Speaker 1 No.
00:03:03 Speaker 2 Just out of curiosity, how much insulin would it?
00:03:05 Speaker 2 Take to kill someone that wasn't a diabetic or.
00:03:07 Speaker 1 See, I don't know.
00:03:09 Speaker 1 I don't know.
00:03:11 Speaker 1 So.
00:03:13 Speaker 2 You didn't know.
00:03:14 Speaker 2 That, the nurse said this amount or.
00:03:15 Speaker 1 No, there is no set amount.
00:03:19 Speaker 2 And I'm just I.
00:03:20 Speaker 1 Yeah. No, there.
00:03:20 Speaker 2 Just simply just don't know that interest, that's.
00:03:22 Speaker 2 Fine.
00:03:24 Speaker 2 Right. So different people would react differently to different amounts of that first and they would obviously make a difference if they were diabetic.
00:03:27 Speaker 1 Yes. Yeah.
00:03:32 Speaker 2 Or not a diabetic?
00:03:33 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:03:35 Speaker 1 I believe she died that day.
00:03:38 Speaker 2 And it said you'll.
00:03:41 Speaker 2 Hear the doctor declared her to be affiliative.
00:03:43 Speaker 2 And she died two days later.
00:03:45 Speaker 2 And do you remember?
00:03:46 Speaker 2 How much influence that you had given her?
00:03:50 Speaker 1 60.
00:03:52 Speaker 2 And where would you got that from?
00:03:53 Speaker 1 From from the same place I would get it.
00:03:57 Speaker 2 Do you remember where Allen was in in Crescent here?
00:04:00 Speaker 1 Yes, she was on the South wing.
00:04:02 Speaker 1 And.
00:04:04 Speaker 1 Probably about four doors down from the nurses station in a.
00:04:08 Speaker 1 Double room on the.
00:04:10 Speaker 1 The right hand side, if you're facing the.
00:04:12 Speaker 1 End.
00:04:13 Speaker 1 She is on the right hand side.
00:04:19 Speaker 2 You don't say a lot of negative things about.
00:04:21 Speaker 2 How you're did.
00:04:22 Speaker 2 You did you get along?
00:04:23 Speaker 2 With her, OK.
00:04:23 Speaker 2 Did you ever do anything to harm you or?
00:04:26 Speaker 1 No, no. She was very quiet.
00:04:29 Speaker 1 It was just back up that feeling of this, you know, she's next to the time so.
00:04:36 Speaker 2 And.
00:04:39 Speaker 2 Her health at that point was for diagnosis.
00:04:41 Speaker 1 Choose.
00:04:44 Speaker 1 Couldn't tell you her diagnosis, just that she was she didn't get out of bed a lot and she had to be fed her food and.
00:04:50 Speaker 1 Fed her pills.
00:04:52 Speaker 1 So she she was near her end and like.
00:04:55 Speaker 2 How old do you think, Ellen?
00:04:56 Speaker 2 Was when this happened?
00:05:00 Speaker 1 Library.
00:05:03 Speaker 2 Do you remember what Doctor would?
00:05:04 Speaker 2 Have were you there when?
00:05:06 Speaker 2 She passed away the two days later.
00:05:07 Speaker 1 I don't think.
00:05:08 Speaker 2 So you know, see one would be. Which doctor? Are you sure?
00:05:13 Speaker 1 Once I gave the information there.
00:05:19 Speaker 1 Kind of laid low and didn't.
00:05:21 Speaker 1 Yeah. And then you can.
00:05:25 Speaker 2 So so if you.
00:05:27 Speaker 2 Issued an insulin injection to somebody. How and for instance, do you remember where Halen was injected?
00:05:33 Speaker 1 Probably her arm.
00:05:35 Speaker 2 OK.
00:05:37 Speaker 2 So do you remember she had a?
00:05:39 Speaker 2 Reaction at all.
00:05:41 Speaker 1 The reaction?
00:05:42 Speaker 2 You know.
00:05:42 Speaker 2 If she.
00:05:43 Speaker 2 Confronted you and what you were doing at all.
00:05:45 Speaker 2 Was she able to?
00:05:46 Speaker 1 Mentor now.
00:05:49 Speaker 2 Which you used to getting.
00:05:52 Speaker 2 Implant or needles or?
00:05:52 Speaker 1 I don't know. She was.
00:05:57 Speaker 2 But she wasn't combative. Or she confront you and ask you what you were doing.
00:06:02 Speaker 1 No.
00:06:04 Speaker 2 And and you said once once you gave them their insulin.
00:06:08 Speaker 1 You just, I just kind of. I tried to stay away from it sometimes I was very interested to see what was happening. I would just try to stay away from it.
00:06:16 Speaker 2 Would you ever go back into their rooms if while they were still alive, to see how they're progressing through the?
00:06:22 Speaker 1 If they were, if they were my.
00:06:24 Speaker 1 If they were mania charge. Yes, I got you.
00:06:28 Speaker 2 Even though you have.
00:06:29 Speaker 2 Attempted to take their lives.
00:06:31 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:06:32 Speaker 2 And you would.
00:06:35 Speaker 2 What kind of symptoms would they?
00:06:37 Speaker 2 Show were they different for everyone or?
00:06:39 Speaker 1 Well, usually they get very diaphoretic red.
00:06:44 Speaker 1 They could lose consciousness. They shake some people. One person has seizure. Think it was just one person.
00:06:53 Speaker 1 Two people stroke traders.
00:06:57 Speaker 2 Right after receiving.
00:06:59 Speaker 1 Not right after, but they stroked, hosed.
00:07:01 Speaker 2 Overtime.
00:07:04 Speaker 1 You can actually three people because they believe James Stroke does as well. So that's just so helpful to have.
00:07:08 Speaker 2 Mr. OK.
00:07:16 Speaker 2 OK, November 2011, Mary is there when you recall.
00:07:23 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:07:26 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:07:27 Speaker 2 And this was that correct? Yeah. OK. And you said that she wasn't.
00:07:30 Speaker 2 A diabetic, but she had dementia.
00:07:32 Speaker 1 That's right. But she could talk and communicate a lot.
00:07:35 Speaker 2 Mary.
00:07:36 Speaker 1 She was. She was feisty. Yeah.
00:07:41 Speaker 1 Soon here at the nursing home, and she's experience sold novice see and.
00:07:46 Speaker 1 One night, she said, you know, I'm going to die tonight.
00:07:49 Speaker 1 Yeah. And I said, oh, and she said, yeah, why don't you get me into the why don't you get me into the deathbed so I can die?
00:07:57 Speaker 1 Are you sure?
00:07:58 Speaker 1 That's what we did, that I didn't die.
00:08:01 Speaker 1 So I said OK and I went to the other nurse.
00:08:03 Speaker 1 That was working with.
00:08:04 Me.
00:08:05 Speaker 1 And she said, oh, OK, well, let's put him inside his care room, if that's what you.
00:08:11 Speaker 1 So we did. And then I thought, well, she must be the next one. I had a feeling should be she must.
00:08:17 Speaker 1 Be the next one.
00:08:19 Speaker 1 Because she was saying she was going to die. But there's no time. She just gonna die. So I gave her an hour and she became higher. Then she died.
00:08:29 Speaker 1 Thanks in a couple of days.
00:08:35 Speaker 2 Document.
00:08:44 Speaker 1 Hey.
00:08:46 Speaker 1 Which one has the vodka in it?
00:08:50 Speaker 2 No answer from him.
00:08:54 So.
00:09:33 Speaker 2 Where was that in relation to where she was and where was Mary and Chris and here?
00:09:36 Speaker 1 He was down the sampling.
00:09:39 Speaker 1 Couple of rooms down from the the.
00:09:43 Speaker 1 Down from the nurses office. And she? Yeah. So we did put her in the pipe in bed.
00:09:50 Speaker 2 And would that be a decision?
00:09:51 Speaker 2 That you would make or someone else would have to make for you.
00:09:53 Speaker 1 Together we made it.
00:09:55 Speaker 2 But a supervisor wouldn't have to and say OK, go ahead and.
00:09:57 Speaker 1 No, no. We had, we have enough autonomy that if we thought someone was paid, if we could call the doctor, tell them what was going on. Moving, move the person to the palliative bed and get orders for positive care.
00:10:14 Speaker 2 And do you remember how much insulin you would have given Mary?
00:10:17 Speaker 1 I think she may have been the first person that I did in long acting and short acting 2 together.
00:10:24 Speaker 2 And communities, besides the actual obvious in the title of the actual drug itself, long acting and short acting, what was the biggest difference between the?
00:10:34 Speaker 1 211 drops your blood sugar right away. The other starts working through your body and dropping it gradually over.
00:10:43 Speaker 1 Long periods of time.
00:10:44 Speaker 1 But it just keeps dropping it.
00:10:46 Speaker 2 And what would the combination?
00:10:47 Speaker 2 Of those two do together.
00:10:48 Speaker 1 Ah, there's so much I didn't know for sure, but I figured it would be much stronger than just.
00:10:49 Speaker 2 Did you know or?
00:10:53 Speaker 1 The short acting.
00:10:58 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:11:00 Speaker 2 You know, do you remember where you injected Mary? Probably her.
00:11:08 Speaker 1 I told her. I told her it's her pain.
00:11:12 Speaker 2 And, you know, she was in a single room. Double room.
00:11:14 Speaker 1 While we had moved her from the double room to the living care room, right catered corner from the nursing home.
00:11:21 Speaker 2 So where did you inject her? In the bed or her?
00:11:23 Speaker 1 In Italian.
00:11:26 Speaker 2 And she she had vocalized to you that she thought that she was going to die that night.
00:11:30 Speaker 1 Yeah. So I said, OK, she must be the one. When I gave the info and I got that feeling inside and the laughter.
00:11:38 Speaker 2 Has she ever said something like something to you before but wanting?
00:11:41 Speaker 1 To die? Not like that. No. She's like, I want to die. I want to die. I want to die tonight. I'm going to die.
00:11:49 Speaker 2 You know.
00:11:50 Speaker 2 New to you?
00:11:51 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:11:52 Speaker 2 Do you remember what ship?
00:11:53 Speaker 2 You're working.
00:11:55 Speaker 1 Afternoon, 3:00 to 11:00.
00:11:58 Speaker 2 And about what time do you think you would have moved into?
00:12:00 Speaker 2 The positive bed and.
00:12:01 Speaker 1 I am.
00:12:05 Speaker 1 Might have been after supper, so both 7.
00:12:09 Speaker 2 And marry everything to harm you or.
00:12:11 Speaker 1 No, no, not too funny.
00:12:12 Speaker 2 I'll tell you anyway.
00:12:18 Speaker 2 You're funky and outspoken. Yeah. Do you remember being present when she died?
00:12:26 Speaker 1 I don't think I was.
00:12:28 Speaker 2 Right. And therefore probably wouldn't be a part.
00:12:31 Speaker 2 Of checking the boxes.
00:12:32 Speaker 1 No, no, I didn't live off this record.
00:12:38 Speaker 2 Who was there to see Mary on a regular basis, looking to see Mary and?
00:12:43 Speaker 2 You know, if you had family.
00:12:47 Speaker 1 Maybe fun?
00:12:50 Speaker 1 But I don't know.
00:13:00 Speaker 2 And Mary being.
00:13:02 Speaker 2 Will refer to her as your 4th victim. Use another 4th.
00:13:04 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:13:06 Speaker 2 Personent and well.
00:13:08 Speaker 2 That you were successful in.
00:13:12 Speaker 2 And insulin injections.
00:13:14 Speaker 2 How did your motion start?
00:13:15 Speaker 2 To to feel it is kept continuing.
00:13:16 Speaker 1 I am.
00:13:21 Speaker 1 I kept having a lot of help.
00:13:23 Speaker 1 A lot of guilt.
00:13:28 Speaker 1 Mary.
00:13:30 Speaker 1 Well, as you'll see, after Mary was bodice and after gladice, there was.
00:13:36 Speaker 1 A period of two years work I.
00:13:38 Speaker 1 Didn't do it.
00:13:40 Speaker 1 Three years.
00:13:44 Speaker 2 What was going on in your life at that point?
00:13:46 Speaker 1 I was trying very, very hard to get close to God to make sure that this wasn't him and to just live my life, read the Bible, go to church and not do that. Anyone do it anymore.
00:14:00 Speaker 1 So I tried very.
00:14:01 Speaker 1 Hard.
00:14:02 Speaker 1 I'm still using a little bit more.
00:14:06 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:14:08 Speaker 2 Yeah. What was your great choice?
00:14:11 Speaker 1 Right. Shouldn't say it like that, but I.
00:14:12 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:14:14 Speaker 1 Think it sounds like it.
00:14:15 Speaker 1 Yeah, right. Brian. Bill is. Yeah. Yeah. Papa Ryan, pop down some water. Yeah. Yeah. Ryan water.
00:14:24 Speaker 2 And.
00:14:26 Speaker 2 Typically, how much would you would you really? Yeah.
00:14:33 Speaker 2 Like like shots of rye or.
00:14:36 Speaker 1 Drink. I don't know.
00:14:40 Speaker 1 If you get it all those shots.
00:14:43 Speaker 1 I don't do drinks so like 3 * 9.
00:14:47 Speaker 1 27.
00:14:48 Speaker 2 So you'd be drinking triples.
00:14:50 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:14:53 Speaker 2 How would that make you feel?
00:14:54 Speaker 2 Like in combination with the higher Marks and.
00:14:57 Speaker 1 I never did it with the head remark.
00:14:59 Speaker 2 No, it was either one.
00:15:00 Speaker 2 Of the other ends.
00:15:00 Speaker 1 One of the other because the business is margin.
00:15:04 Speaker 1 For when I didn't have the 100 mark.
00:15:08 Speaker 1 And if I was going out, but I think that with people I was going to mostly by myself and just.
00:15:13 Speaker 1 At the scratch and win tickets into foods and drinks.
00:15:24 Speaker 2 Uh.
00:15:30 Speaker 2 Is significant.
00:15:32 Speaker 2 And disturbing, and this may be the the people that are going to hear this and learn.
00:15:35 Speaker 2 About this, obviously.
00:15:36 Speaker 2 There's a lot of families that are going to.
00:15:38 Speaker 2 Contact.
00:15:39 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:15:39 Speaker 2 And speak to.
00:15:43 Speaker 2 Although this wasn't, and I hate to classify it in the different.
00:15:48 Speaker 2 Areas, but these were.
00:15:51 Speaker 2 Necessarily violent deaths, like how did do you think these people died peacefully did.
00:15:56 Speaker 2 They struggle at all.
00:15:58 Speaker 1 All the things that you've talked about so far, now peacefully in my.
00:16:01 Speaker 1 Opinion and I am sorry.
00:16:05 Speaker 1 I searched for what the families went through at the time and I'm extremely.
00:16:09 Speaker 1 Sorry for what they're going to do.
00:16:12 Speaker 1 It's awful.
00:16:15 Speaker 2 If you could say something.
00:16:20 Speaker 1 What can you say?
00:16:21 Speaker 1 To them, that would matter. I'm. I'm sorry isn't enough.
00:16:27 Speaker 1 I should have gotten help sooner.
00:16:32 Speaker 1 I just something from you that was precious and speaking too soon.
00:16:38 Speaker 1 I honestly believe that the time that.
00:16:40 Speaker 1 God wanted me to do it.
00:16:43 Speaker 1 But I know now that's not true.
00:16:45 Speaker 1 And.
00:16:48 Speaker 1 If I could take it back, if I could get help sooner, I would.
00:16:55 Speaker 2 Like I said correctly, whether it took one year, 2 years, 10 years, whatever it took for you to finally get help, then that's a big step.
00:17:05 Speaker 2 Thank you. You could have been in the situation and.
00:17:08 Speaker 2 Taking this to your grave.
00:17:09 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:17:13 Speaker 1 That's what I was hoping to.
00:17:14 Speaker 2 Do by a lawyer. What's up?
00:17:17 Speaker 1 Take to my grave and don't tell anybody.
00:17:20 Speaker 2 So you can find it.
00:17:21 Speaker 2 In a layer as well with this.
00:17:22 Speaker 1 A long time ago, yeah.
00:17:25 Speaker 2 With it, after all these people.
00:17:27 Speaker 1 It was in 2014, before I.
00:17:33 Speaker 2 And following the line or sorry to rehash that.
00:17:34 Speaker 1 Yes, the Welland cobra. Yes, the rehab center.
00:17:39 Speaker 2 So you spoke to a lawyer.
00:17:40 Speaker 1 Spoke to the lawyer and that she was going and told me to get out. I need to go back.
00:17:45 Speaker 2 No.
00:17:47 Speaker 2 Just for the.
00:17:48 Speaker 2 Record and it was documented I have.
00:17:50 Speaker 2 626 just take a break, OK?
00:17:53 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:17:58 Speaker 2 And where you're going.
00:18:13 So.
00:18:25 Speaker 2 All set you need anything else at all? You sure?
00:18:28 Speaker 1 No.
00:18:32 Speaker 2 Perfect.
00:18:37 Speaker 2 Just where the record is.
00:18:40 Speaker 2 I have 30 and I will just resume things.
00:18:52 Speaker 2 OK.
00:18:56 Speaker 1 OK. Yeah. OK.
00:18:59 Speaker 1 This.
00:19:02 Speaker 2 So Gladys.
00:19:03 Speaker 2 So let's take this.
00:19:04 Speaker 2 To November of 2011 at Crescent Care says you're Gladys was a Type 2 diabetic and high dementia dementia. Did she? You know, how old do you think Glass was?
00:19:17 Speaker 2 909230 and where was Gladys within percent here.
00:19:23 Speaker 1 Swings.
00:19:26 Speaker 1 3 Doors Down from the main desk in a double room.
00:19:30 Speaker 2 You remember the remakes at home.
00:19:31 Yes.
00:19:32 Speaker 2 No.
00:19:34 Speaker 2 And we see these are repetitive questions.
00:19:36 And.
00:19:38 Speaker 2 You might remember some of the roommates drove as we go along here.
00:19:41 Speaker 2 So that's.
00:19:42 Speaker 2 Just keep asking questions.
00:19:46 Speaker 2 Tell me a little bit about last. What did you would you like me to search for?
00:19:48 Speaker 1 Oh.
00:19:50 Speaker 1 Well, when I first started caring for her, she was walking and talking when she.
00:19:53 Speaker 1 Had quite the.
00:19:53 Speaker 1 Spirit, she was she was punched a man.
00:19:58 Speaker 1 Oh.
00:19:59 Speaker 1 Because she overheard the nurses telling one of the gentlemen. No, you can't push your wife around. You have to come with us. And she turned around. She said you can't treat a woman.
00:20:09 Speaker 1 Like that.
00:20:12 Speaker 2 And the man.
00:20:13 Speaker 1 And his the man. So then we're all in a state of trying to keep them from fighting with each other and.
00:20:18 Speaker 1 Trying to keep.
00:20:19 Speaker 1 Them from hurting us, right? Yeah. She was very fun, but she went down downhill fast.
00:20:25 Speaker 2 Fishing.
00:20:26 Speaker 1 Eventually she was. She had dementia, didn't take her pills well, didn't eat well. Very stubborn woman and.
00:20:36 Speaker 1 As always, one evening I just got that.
00:20:39 Speaker 1 Red surging feeling that she was going to be the one and.
00:20:45 Speaker 1 Give your insulin over there.
00:20:48 Speaker 2 Did you ever get that feeling outside of work?
00:20:51 Speaker 1 No, never.
00:20:52 Speaker 2 You know, did you ever.
00:20:53 Speaker 2 Get that feeling going to work?
00:20:54 Speaker 2 Knowing that something was going to happen that shift.
00:20:57 Speaker 1 Now it's happening at work.
00:20:59 Speaker 2 So.
00:21:01 Speaker 2 Release and praise for in the moment. Would it be something that you just have?
00:21:04 Speaker 2 That feeling come.
00:21:05 Speaker 1 On, yeah, I guess you could say well for the moment, but it was.
00:21:06 Speaker 2 With bill.
00:21:09 Speaker 1 Is usually they're happening, you know, focused on one patient and then I would feel that road searching, which is what made me think.
00:21:16 Speaker 1 It was God.
00:21:19 Speaker 1 The time zone there.
00:21:21 Speaker 2 Like I said, I'm not here.
00:21:22 Speaker 2 To judge you, right, right.
00:21:23 Speaker 1 Hi.
00:21:28 Speaker 2 You said you've seen that it was difficult for towards the end during our bills. Do you remember what you were working with the shift when injected glass?
00:21:38 Speaker 1 I believe I was working because I've been working nights or days.
00:21:44 Speaker 1 Because I know it was close to the end of my shift.
00:21:47 Speaker 2 OK.
00:21:48 Speaker 1 So they did it, and the person who came on next shift, I think it.
00:21:51 Speaker 1 Was.
00:21:51 Speaker 1 Night. So the person who came on next shift checked her all over and started called the doctor and had her made palliative.
00:21:58 Speaker 1 And.
00:21:59 Speaker 1 They're they're on the pain pain regimen and.
00:22:03 Speaker 2 Do you remember how much insulin you gave her?
00:22:05 Speaker 1 Find out.
00:22:06 Speaker 2 Do you remember if it was long or?
00:22:07 Speaker 2 Short or a mess.
00:22:08 Speaker 1 I I probably at that point, I think it was giving everybody a mic.
00:22:12 Speaker 2 OK, so once once Mary was the 1st.
00:22:14 Speaker 2 Person you know that.
00:22:14 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:22:15 Speaker 2 You gave the the long and the short acting and then following that it was launched long from there.
00:22:19 Speaker 1 Everybody. Yeah.
00:22:23 Speaker 2 And that was again at Crescent Care. Would that influence taken from the same?
00:22:25 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:22:27 Speaker 2 Location as you always would.
00:22:27 Speaker 1 Yes, yes.
00:22:29 Speaker 2 Is there cameras in?
00:22:31 Speaker 1 No, no, no.
00:22:33 Speaker 2 Nothing. Nothing at all. So you could access whatever you like and.
00:22:34 Speaker 1 No.
00:22:38 Speaker 1 Well, not whatever you like. But yeah, the insulin, the insulin.
00:22:40 Speaker 2 But the insulin, because, she said.
00:22:42 Speaker 2 They didn't even keep track of it.
00:22:46 Speaker 1 Yeah, this one needs to get volume needs get like injectable volume.
00:22:53 Speaker 1 Yeah, it was fairly.
00:22:54 Speaker 1 Easy to take meds from there.
00:23:01 Speaker 2 We're getting cancer. I was going to ask the question, but we didn't get down.
00:23:04 Speaker 2 The.
00:23:04 Speaker 2 Road, you know.
00:23:06 Speaker 2 How long it took for Gladys to die?
00:23:08 Speaker 1 I believe she died the next afternoon or that afternoon.
00:23:12 Speaker 2 And you know, if you're present for that.
00:23:14 Speaker 1 No, not.
00:23:15 Speaker 2 So therefore we have been a part of the.
00:23:18 Speaker 2 The process of the pronouncing and checking the boxes.
00:23:21 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:23:26 Speaker 1 When someones dying it seems like.
00:23:27 Speaker 1 It takes longer than it does if you're around, if you know what I mean, yeah.
00:23:36 Speaker 2 Thank you.
00:23:40 Speaker 2 As far as glass goes, do you remember if you worked the next day to to learn about glass and death or?
00:23:48 Speaker 1 I think I worked two days later. I think I worked the day after her.
00:23:52 Speaker 1 Death whenever that was.
00:23:55 Speaker 2 What would play through your mind on on your days where you inject so glass for instance you?
00:24:00 Speaker 2 After you work nights, it says here so it's 11 till seven. You did this at 5:00. You go home and carry it on and off. If you have one 2-3 days off. Whatever these days was what was punch your mind on what days off were you thinking when when 5 is going to die?
00:24:02 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:24:08 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:24:12 Speaker 1 You know.
00:24:14 Speaker 1 I would wonder if she had died, I would wonder.
00:24:17 Speaker 1 You know, if this would be the time, I would get caught. You know, what was I going every time? Every time I walked in after somebody who passed away, I always wondered this is.
00:24:26 Speaker 1 They are going to get caught.
00:24:30 What kind of?
00:24:31 Speaker 2 Consequences. Place your hand. OK? Like if you.
00:24:35 Speaker 2 Damn. I'm caught the gigs up.
00:24:37 Speaker 2 What kind of consequences do?
00:24:38 Speaker 2 You think you're gonna face? If that were to happen back in 2011?
00:24:40 Speaker 1 Are you?
00:24:42 Speaker 1 Fired jail.
00:24:46 Speaker 1 No more nursing license.
00:24:49 Speaker 1 That's exactly what I'm looking at now, otherwise because my cell phone, instead of being fired but.
00:24:54 Speaker 2 Right.
00:24:55 Speaker 1 Jail and no more alert nursing licenses.
00:24:57 Speaker 2 As far as.
00:25:00 Speaker 2 In 2011, though, and and having that feeling like when did those feelings start to say in your mind, like or if this is the time going to get caught happen right at Mr. Silcox or?
00:25:09 Speaker 1 Probably every time. Yeah, probably every time, yeah.
00:25:09 Speaker 2 Did it.
00:25:14 Speaker 2 UM.
00:25:16 Speaker 2 And Gladys, do you think did she have a reaction when you injected her?
00:25:21 Speaker 1 She fought a.
00:25:21 Speaker 1 Little bit.
00:25:23 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:25:23 Speaker 2 What do you mean by that?
00:25:24 Speaker 1 Like she struggled around. So I I kind of thought on her legs that I could do where she couldn't reach me intentionally.
00:25:31 Speaker 2 Would that be something typical if you were giving her medication? She got your attention.
00:25:33 Speaker 1 Yeah, pinch.
00:25:35 Speaker 1 Scratch.
00:25:37 Speaker 1 Per month, yeah.
00:25:38 Speaker 1 My ambitions, and like even the the PSA's who had to change their product. Sometimes you fight them and scratch them and pinch them and twist their hair and yeah.
00:25:52 Speaker 2 Do you think that played into any part of your actions with Gladys, particularly with that?
00:25:58 Speaker 1 I don't know. I think some of the.
00:26:02 Speaker 1 I think some of it did. You know, the stubborn Netflix stuff and.
00:26:06 Speaker 1 Yeah, just kind of. OK. You're the next one to go again. There was always that red surgeon that I identified with God telling me.
00:26:15 Speaker 1 This is 1.
00:26:17 Speaker 1 Yeah, this is how you work for me.
00:26:19 Speaker 2 Did you ever try and fight that feeling?
00:26:22 Speaker 1 Later on, as you'll see.
00:26:27 Speaker 2 But when you.
00:26:27 Speaker 2 Got that feeling?
00:26:29 Speaker 2 In your chest.
00:26:29 Speaker 2 And stomach, would you, would you directly go to get?
00:26:32 Speaker 2 The insulin.
00:26:33 Speaker 1 Pretty much as soon as I had time with the rest of my job.
00:26:38 Speaker 2 How many patients would you be caring for during on one shift? You'd be responsible for all 32, so each nurse would have 32.
00:26:40 Speaker 1 There's.
00:26:42 Speaker 1 32.
00:26:45 Speaker 1 Yeah, 32 nurse. Our registered practical nurse registered practical nurse.
00:26:53 Speaker 2 OK.
00:26:55 Speaker 2 So that's a busy day and I know.
00:26:58 Speaker 2 We talked about it earlier, but.
00:27:00 Speaker 2 Again, just to revisit that.
00:27:01 Speaker 2 Do you think that's something that played into?
00:27:03 Speaker 2 This.
00:27:04 Speaker 2 I think the stresses of.
00:27:05 Speaker 2 The job.
00:27:05 Speaker 1 Oh yes, I definitely can. Now. Yeah, I definitely think that maybe made me made my mind more susceptible to.
00:27:07 Speaker 2 We have a lot going on in your life.
00:27:17 Speaker 2 Did you ever go?
00:27:17 Speaker 2 To work intoxicated by alcohol or drugs at all.
00:27:21 Speaker 1 No.
00:27:22 Speaker 2 Did you ever use?
00:27:22 Speaker 2 That work, yes.
00:27:26 Speaker 2 Often.
00:27:29 Speaker 1 Probably once or twice a week. Yeah, yeah.
00:27:33 Speaker 2 And when you wrap Crescent.
00:27:34 Speaker 2 Care. Where would you have done?
00:27:35 Speaker 1 Your mushroom a number of ways you can get them right. You can sign off that somebody got their sign off, that somebody on the PRM and take it instead, you can.
00:27:50 Speaker 1 Taking their regular medication, and if they're not able to identify it, take it instead. You can take the regular medication that's in capsule, and if they are able to identify it, open the capsule, take the step out the capsule back together again, give them, and then the castle. Take it yourself.
00:28:09 Speaker 2 And how would you typically adjust the item worse?
00:28:11 Speaker 1 I just followed it. I never shouted. I never started it. Yeah.
00:28:18 Speaker 2 And you remember how much you gave Gladys.
00:28:20 Speaker 1 Of the insulin.
00:28:23 Speaker 1 I think I gave her 8060.
00:28:26 Speaker 1 I think.
00:28:28 Speaker 2 And her reaction? And after after kind of hinged and.
00:28:33 Speaker 2 Struggled a little bit.
00:28:33 Speaker 1 With you he relaxed, and then by the time the next nurse came on, she was red. She was sweating and she was incoherent. She her blood, her vital signs rolled down.
00:28:34 Yeah.
00:28:47 Speaker 2 And how do you know that?
00:28:49 Speaker 1 Because I was just leaving when the next nurse came on and.
00:28:52 Speaker 1 She.
00:28:53 Speaker 1 TSW skin to her and she said something going on with clothes and see. She said come with me. We have to go check on clothes.
00:28:59 Speaker 2 And Richard?
00:29:00 Speaker 1 Yeah. So I actually helped you move farther to the highest here.
00:29:05 Speaker 2 Dear.
00:29:06 Speaker 1 Scared out of my guards the whole time, it was something I did.
00:29:10 Speaker 2 OK. Was she still?
00:29:11 Speaker 1 Able to communicate at that point, no?
00:29:14 Speaker 2 Do you remember what nurse that was?
00:29:15 Speaker 2 That you moved advice.
00:29:16 Speaker 1 Karen, I don't mind your last name. If I thought something.
00:29:21 Speaker 1 How?
00:29:25 Speaker 2 Just be one of the things.
00:29:27 Speaker 2 Great.
00:29:28 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:29:31 Speaker 2 Rutledge. Karen Rutledge. Yeah.
00:29:37 Speaker 2 You still there?
00:29:38 Speaker 1 Yeah, I know.
00:29:47 OK.
00:29:51 Speaker 2 Mrs. Holly young.
00:29:53 Speaker 2 So this is where you have a bit of a gap. Again 2011 to 2013 with your successful injections, but there was and there wasn't even any attempt in.
00:29:56 Yeah.
00:29:58 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:30:02 Speaker 1 No, no. In November 2011, I came home from a.
00:30:08 Speaker 1 Cruise of the Caribbean and.
00:30:12 Speaker 1 I was feeling guilty. I was feeling damned. I was feeling confused. I I feel like I just didn't want to do it anymore. I was feeling like if I could somehow connect with God.
00:30:26 Speaker 1 Strongly enough that I wouldn't do it anymore.
00:30:30 Speaker 1 And so I spent a lot of time reading my Bible and praying and deciding I just wasn't going to do it anymore.
00:30:39 Speaker 1 So.
00:30:41 Speaker 1 And I had the odd urge to do it, but I resisted by going to church, reading my Bible, praying.
00:30:49 Speaker 1 And telling God I didn't believe him, that he wanted me.
00:30:51 Speaker 1 To do it anymore.
00:30:53 Speaker 2 With your treatment.
00:30:54 Speaker 2 To that one.
00:31:01 Speaker 2 OK.
00:31:02 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:31:17 Speaker 2 So as far as.
00:31:19 Speaker 2 Fighting off that, do you? Would you still have that feeling like that burning feeling?
00:31:22 Speaker 1 Sometimes, but I did a lot of praying about it and I would. I just did a lot of praying, reading my Bible, getting very involved in my in my face, getting very involved in my church.
00:31:33 Right.
00:31:36 Speaker 2 I did and obviously.
00:31:39 Speaker 2 With what you've told us so far that it helps what you've documented. Is there anything else that we need to be aware of that happening?
00:31:42 Yes.
00:31:45 Speaker 2 Between those types.
00:31:46 Speaker 1 No, no, I didn't tell anybody or anything like that.
00:31:53 Speaker 2 Except for.
00:31:57 Speaker 1 That was, I told him after Helen Young.
00:32:01 Speaker 1 He was that.
00:32:03 Speaker 2 Library and I apologize for that.
00:32:07 Speaker 1 Apologize for that.
00:32:08 Speaker 2 There we go.
00:32:13 Speaker 2 So that was after Helen.
00:32:16 Speaker 2 Right. OK. So Helen was at Crescent Care, where was where was?
00:32:24 Speaker 1 She was on a site that has been transferred to a side, which is the new unit label relatively new than 10.
00:32:31 Speaker 1 12 years old.
00:32:32 Speaker 1 I was on the 1st floor. I was.
00:32:34 Speaker 1 The charge nurse.
00:32:36 Speaker 1 To the first floor.
00:32:38 Speaker 1 And she was.
00:32:41 Speaker 1 In the room closest to the nursing station.
00:32:46 Speaker 2 Where? So where would he like for me going to here would be close to 5 or closer.
00:32:52 Speaker 2 To nose to have.
00:32:57 Speaker 1 Retirement home there.
00:33:02 Speaker 1 So all the change your time time to the.
00:33:08 Speaker 1 To the nursing home.
00:33:12 Speaker 1 Not fine.
00:33:16 Speaker 1 That's fine.
00:33:20 Speaker 1 Easling.
00:33:23 Speaker 1 And then.
00:33:25 Speaker 1 Then, then the hallway SE wind is.
00:33:31 Speaker 1 You have one unit 2 in the building, right?
00:33:32 Speaker 1 On top of each other.
00:33:34 Speaker 2 And what was the purpose of that area?
00:33:36 Speaker 1 Of it was, it was all single one.
00:33:39 Speaker 2 OK.
00:33:41 Speaker 1 Now I'll move it around then. Yeah, it was all anywhere out of the area.
00:33:46 Speaker 2 All right. And and how long would it take to diabetic with dementia?
00:33:51 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:33:53 Speaker 2 Tell me a little bit more.
00:33:54 Speaker 1 How was Mr. folk? She recently yellowed, helped me, nurse. She frequently yelled out she wanted to die. She just was not happy with her life. She was wheel wheel around in a wheelchair, saying helping nurse help a nurse help a nurse help a nurse. And when you went to help her, what do you want help with? Like, get away with me. Go away.
00:34:14 Speaker 1 Helping nurse helping nurse.
00:34:15 Speaker 1 Didn't want to eat, didn't want.
00:34:17 Speaker 1 To drink, it's very difficult to deal with.
00:34:22 Speaker 1 Constantly with yellow and early to say what you want help, but I want to die. Why can't you help me die? I want to die and one night it was like something snapped inside and that red surge came back and I thought, OK, you look like.
00:34:36 Speaker 1 So.
00:34:38 Speaker 1 I gave her a shot. I came out to her, said this through your pain and I gave her a shot of long acting. Her short acting and she started to settle down and then later on we put it in her into bed and I gave him more. More.
00:34:52 Speaker 1 Of the insulin, I think that.
00:34:54 Speaker 1 Was wrong last time.
00:34:56 Speaker 1 She had a seizure. She turned red. She was diaphoretic. The PSW's called me to the bedside. I took all of her vital signs, and I pretended to take both sugar.
00:35:12 Speaker 1 And today is normal. So worry about it.
00:35:15 Speaker 2 How did you go about that with people?
00:35:18 Speaker 1 That's here.
00:35:21 Speaker 1 Don't know. Don't let anybody.
00:35:23 Speaker 2 No of them.
00:35:23 Speaker 1 See that part of the.
00:35:24 Speaker 2 W's.
00:35:25 Speaker 1 No, but what I mean is what I mean by that is TSW nurses, nurses focus on the meds and treatment. TSW is focused on like they were busy. They're busy watching her. They were busy changing her.
00:35:39 Speaker 1 They're busy dealing with the fact that she was having diarrhea.
00:35:42 Speaker 1 They were not doing the part of the job I was doing, so they never would have noticed.
00:35:45 Speaker 2 Right.
00:35:50 Speaker 1 Where's my burger?
00:35:53 Speaker 1 So they never would have noticed me not taking the butcher because I took her like I did her call. So I did everything else so they wouldn't have noticed that it didn't do that because.
00:36:03 Speaker 1 They were busy with everything else.
00:36:05 Speaker 2 And you just.
00:36:08 Speaker 2 Emotion record.
00:36:10 Speaker 1 5.6, she said.
00:36:12 Speaker 2 Which is a number that your mind knew is average and nothing returning 5.6 or whatever you say.
00:36:17 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah.
00:36:21 Speaker 2 Do you remember what shift you?
00:36:22 Speaker 2 Were working at this point.
00:36:23 Speaker 1 Afternoon. I was straight through to 11th at that point and straight through to 11:00 on that ward.
00:36:29 Speaker 1 That it's starting a little bit before that, yeah.
00:36:33 Speaker 2 And that would have been an.
00:36:34 Speaker 2 Individual order and you say.
00:36:37 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:36:42 Speaker 2 As young guys.
00:36:43 Speaker 1 1-2 days after.
00:36:46 Speaker 2 You know, if you're.
00:36:48 Speaker 1 No, it wasn't.
00:36:51 Speaker 2 Was there a different procedure at all when people passed away in that in that wing opposed to where you were prior to?
00:36:57 Speaker 1 No, it was all the payment nursing home. It was all the same. Ballsy. Just that that nursing home was that wing of the nursing home was built to accommodate the fact that the owner took over in our villa, right?
00:37:10 Speaker 2 OK, OK.
00:37:12 Speaker 1 So.
00:37:13 Speaker 1 Everybody from their villa got moved to the new part of the nursing home.
00:37:19 Speaker 1 So that's the only reason. And then eventually they all mixed together.
00:37:24 Speaker 2 So being that it had been a few years then.
00:37:28 Speaker 2 When you injected Mrs. Young and.
00:37:33 Speaker 2 You were successful in causing her death.
00:37:37 Speaker 2 How did it make you feel?
00:37:38 Speaker 2 For those few years that these urges and.
00:37:41 Speaker 2 These feelings have come.
00:37:41 Speaker 2 Back.
00:37:42 Speaker 1 I felt horrible. I felt angry at myself.
00:37:46 Speaker 1 I told the salesman as well.
00:37:49 Speaker 1 I felt like God failed. Neat.
00:37:52 Speaker 2 Should you continue to practice in the church?
00:37:55 Speaker 1 I continue going to church, yeah.
00:38:01 Speaker 1 I did, but I was getting very confused.
00:38:05 Speaker 1 So it was soon after that that I.
00:38:06 Speaker 1 Went to the pastor.
00:38:08 Speaker 1 And told him what had happened and he prayed over me. And because he said that was the last thing he would have thought of me and his wife was there too. And they prayed over me and they said to me that this is God's grace.
00:38:23 Speaker 1 But if if you ever do this again, we will have to turn you into the police.
00:38:30 Speaker 2 That conversation.
00:38:31 Speaker 1 In their house.
00:38:37 Speaker 1 I kept going to their church.
00:38:40 Speaker 2 And how detailed did you with the conversation?
00:38:44 Speaker 1 Oh, I had told. I told him that I was taking people's.
00:38:46 Speaker 1 Lives.
00:38:49 Speaker 2 What were you specifically news? How much you when? When you were doing?
00:38:51 Speaker 1 No, no.
00:38:52 Speaker 2 This how many people?
00:38:54 Speaker 1 I don't know if I told them how many people did.
00:38:57 Speaker 1 But I was doing it. I want.
00:39:00 Speaker 2 And his.
00:39:01 Speaker 2 Response was to pray for you and.
00:39:03 Speaker 2 Pray will be everything.
00:39:03 Speaker 1 You could put his hands on me.
00:39:08 Speaker 2 What religion did metric precious?
00:39:20 Speaker 2 Did Helen have any family that you recall that comes in here?
00:39:22 Speaker 1 Yes. Do you have nice would love you very much and move there at least twice a week.
00:39:27 Speaker 2 Did you ever converse with her?
00:39:29 Speaker 1 Before before he died. Yeah, yeah.
00:39:32 Speaker 2 Publishing.
00:39:34 Speaker 1 Let's say in the late 50s, early 60's the 90s.
00:39:44 Speaker 2 Did you speak to her following human sufferings?
00:39:50 Speaker 1 I think it was a day or two after when she was gathering her stuff and she cried on my shoulder. Thank me for.
00:39:57 Speaker 1 Being a partner.
00:40:00 Speaker 2 And again, the feelings that.
00:40:01 Speaker 1 You have at that .0 guilt.
00:40:04 Speaker 1 Change in your.
00:40:07 Speaker 1 Like I had betrayed her. And not that I was betrayed, but betrayal. But I betrayed her.
00:40:14 Speaker 2 And did you display a motion at that point to her?
00:40:17 Speaker 1 I just, you know, gave her husband and said I was so sorry.
00:40:21 Speaker 1 But on that point that I was getting very confused about was this God and wasn't not.
00:40:30 Speaker 2 And when you resume doing this, did you have any besides the religious feelings that you were having? Did you have any other personal?
00:40:41 Speaker 2 Feelings in your mind as far as knowing there's been very wrong again.
00:40:46 Speaker 1 Yes, yes, that is the difference between right and wrong.
00:40:49 Speaker 1 But I thought this was something that God or whoever wanted me to do it. Starting at that point to doubt that it was God, yeah.
00:40:53 Speaker 2 The West, really.
00:40:56 Speaker 2 When you resume doing.
00:41:04 Speaker 2 Was anyone working with you on that day that you can recall?
00:41:07 Speaker 1 The PSW.
00:41:11 Speaker 2 How many? What are?
00:41:12 Speaker 2 There then great.
00:41:14 Speaker 1 It would have been students too, I think.
00:41:16 Speaker 1 But I can't remember.
00:41:17 Speaker 2 And there would have been.
00:41:19 Speaker 2 32 patients.
00:41:20 Speaker 2 And having as well.
00:41:21 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:41:22 Speaker 2 You're responsible for.
00:41:23 So.
00:41:31 Speaker 2 March of 2014.
00:41:40 Speaker 1 Mine was a handful.
00:41:46 Speaker 1 Human attack on the patients who would pull their hair, she would hit them, she would pinch them.
00:41:48 Speaker 2 There.
00:41:52 Speaker 1 Eventually, it was decided that she needed a one-on-one staff, so sometimes they would book an extra PSW to be with her. Sometimes someone will come from the outside to be with her.
00:42:07 Speaker 1 Available.
00:42:12 Speaker 1 That was nuts. Sorry, that's just absolutely nuts.
00:42:18 Speaker 1 So.
00:42:21 Speaker 1 She just got harder and harder to look after and one night when I had had to look after her that.
00:42:25 Speaker 1 Was like he had like, you know.
00:42:28 Speaker 1 I'm starting getting the feeling about surge again, is that no, I don't want her to die. But if I could somehow give her.
00:42:38 Speaker 1 Enough of a.
00:42:38 Speaker 1 Dose please give her a coma or something to change your brain with. Maybe make her less.
00:42:44 Speaker 1 You know, maybe make it less mobile. Hard to handle left handle hard to, you know. So yeah, I was the director.
00:42:54 Speaker 2 And do that in the same way.
00:42:57 Speaker 1 Yes, she was right across. She had gone into the room that Helen had been in.
00:43:05 Speaker 1 Yeah, she's right across from nursing station.
00:43:08 Speaker 2 As well, I'll stay single at that point.
00:43:10 Speaker 1 Yeah, that night she stroked and severe stroke she went to the hospital, and when she came back to fix her few Sarah was nursing home for a few days and she died.
00:43:22 Speaker 1 So before she came back from the hospital, I was fired from Crescent Care.
00:43:27 Speaker 1 For medication errors that had nothing to do with it.
00:43:32 Speaker 2 When you, when you when you got transferred into this viewing, you still get the medication the same way they answer in the same way.
00:43:37 Speaker 1 Yeah, because they've been some subjects there.
00:43:42 Speaker 2 And so sorry, Marine, Miss Pickering.
00:43:48 Speaker 2 Was transferred from Crest Care to the hospital.
00:43:50 Speaker 1 And then, yeah, night.
00:43:52 Speaker 2 How? What was the time frame?
00:43:57 Speaker 1 But they knew that she was totally vegetative.
00:43:59 Speaker 1 When she came back.
00:44:01 Speaker 1 Because they're yeah.
00:44:01 Speaker 2 Which was basically coming back to the last way that our singer returned.
00:44:06 Speaker 1 No, she had her own room. Competitive care room was for people who didn't have her own room so that families could go and be with them and not, you know, not just serve to their residents and not.
00:44:14 Speaker 2 OK.
00:44:18 Speaker 1 Be disturbed by the other residents.
00:44:23 Speaker 2 Do you remember how much information you gave to securities?
00:44:33 Speaker 1 A lot. I'm going to say 80. Long accidents, 50 short acting, something like that. There is a lot.
00:44:40 Speaker 1 Of influence. Why so much?
00:44:43 Speaker 1 Wasn't sure she would die or not, and they really wanted to make sure that she their mind was changed that before she came after.
00:44:53 Speaker 2 So the insulin caused? Sure.
00:44:59 Speaker 2 The child to the hospital.
00:45:00 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:45:03 Speaker 2 Do you remember any reaction from Germany rejecting that? No, none. No. Apologize. What part of the body?
00:45:13 Speaker 2 Left, right.
00:45:17 Speaker 1 But.
00:45:21 Speaker 2 And no reaction.
00:45:24 Speaker 1 Oh, Oh yeah. The first time I gave it to her, she said, hey, what was that for? And I said that's your. That's your vitamin injection.
00:45:24 Speaker 2 And your computer.
00:45:33 Speaker 2 Which is you.
00:45:33 Speaker 2 Said that, you would typically tell people OK.
00:45:35 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:45:37 Speaker 2 How long maybe between when you gave her the?
00:45:40 Speaker 1 Probably an hour and a half. Two hours.
00:45:48 Speaker 2 You're still looking great.
00:45:50 Speaker 1 Yeah, 8:00 or 9:00 at night.
00:45:54 Speaker 2 OK. Yeah. So share that either. Clinic, you gave her eight years.
00:45:59 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:46:01 Speaker 2 Did the miss.
00:46:02 Speaker 2 Pickering, you were calling the family that.
00:46:04 Speaker 1 She had she had two friends that came.
00:46:06 Speaker 1 And saw her a.
00:46:06 Speaker 1 Lot. She had a boyfriend that was coming to see her.
00:46:10 Speaker 2 How old is she?
00:46:12 Speaker 1 82.
00:46:17 Speaker 2 Oh, I have no.
00:46:18 Speaker 2 Idea no basis was there any restrictions on visiting practices at all? Certain hours.
00:46:21 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:46:30 Speaker 1 Basically, no, if they wanted.
00:46:32 Speaker 1 To come late at night, they had to.
00:46:33 Speaker 1 Let us know.
00:46:34 Speaker 1 So we could let them in and then.
00:46:37 Speaker 1 And that was more propitious with people.
00:46:41 Speaker 1 But no, there was no.
00:46:42 Speaker 1 Real restrictions, I mean, there was the odd patient who had a restriction like they can't leave the building with this person or they can't leave the building with that person or so. So she was off call the police.
00:46:55 Speaker 1 That person.
00:46:58 Speaker 2 Do you? Do you remember if?
00:46:59 Speaker 2 Your present, you know.
00:47:01 Speaker 1 I was not. I've already been fired.
00:47:05 Speaker 2 OK, so sorry between the time that she.
00:47:08 Speaker 2 When were you fired?
00:47:12 Speaker 1 Late March, early April.
00:47:15 Speaker 2 Was it when she was at the hospital?
00:47:18 Speaker 1 Here, come back and then I.
00:47:19 Speaker 1 Would like to.
00:47:21 Speaker 1 Good.
00:47:22 Speaker 2 Live for a few more days. You're required in the meantime.
00:47:23 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:47:25 Speaker 1 Yeah. For something that had nothing to do with her.
00:47:28 Speaker 1 And my timeline may be wrong. It may have been February.
00:47:34 Speaker 1 Because I know that.
00:47:37 Speaker 1 And uh by.
00:47:37 Speaker 1 The middle of April I was working again at Meadow Apartments.
00:47:47 Speaker 2 Among yeah. What was the cause of your your firing? I'm sorry. There was a Medicare.
00:47:53 Speaker 1 I haven't had a few medication errors, and strangely enough, not on her wrist.
00:47:59 Speaker 1 One of our residents was missing her.
00:48:03 Speaker 1 Long acting insulin that she got at supper and it was coming from pharmacy, but I wanted to make sure she got her.
00:48:06 OK.
00:48:10 Speaker 1 Insulin.
00:48:11 Speaker 1 So I took insulin from another person who I thought was the same insulin.
00:48:15 Speaker 1 But it was short acting and it gave her a seizure because she.
00:48:19 Speaker 1 Wasn't used to it.
00:48:21 Speaker 1 And she was she was OK. We we helped her and she was all right.
00:48:25 Speaker 1 But when they figured it out, I was fired because I had other.
00:48:30 Speaker 1 Medication errors with love.
00:48:34 Speaker 1 No, no different things. Eye drop.
00:48:41 Speaker 2 And what do you think that was the result of?
00:48:43 Speaker 1 What met air? The workload?
00:48:47 Speaker 2 Yeah. Was it anything to?
00:48:49 Speaker 2 Do with were you still using at?
00:48:51 Speaker 2 This.
00:48:51 Speaker 1 Point you know what? I never made it.
00:48:54 Speaker 1 I never made.
00:48:54 Speaker 1 It work. I never made it. Never. Never.
00:49:00 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:49:02 Speaker 2 Do your committees that.
00:49:06 Speaker 1 No.
00:49:09 Speaker 2 So no mid airs, no deaths.
00:49:14 Speaker 2 Breathing is all the feeling in your chest and your stomach and your.
00:49:17 Speaker 1 Yeah, searching and yet and then the laughter afterwards, which was really it was like a cackling from the head of health, if that makes sense.
00:49:29 Speaker 2 Did the Catholic continue?
00:49:31 Speaker 2 Me.
00:49:34 Speaker 2 Way that the wasn't directed with.
00:49:38 Speaker 2 And after that two year break, yes.
00:49:40 Speaker 1 Yes, it's been cackling. Same feeling same.
00:49:49 Speaker 2 So then you.
00:49:51 Speaker 2 Did you work anywhere between Chris and Kerry? Middleburg. No. Did you go directly from 1:00 to the other?
00:49:56 Speaker 1 Pretty much within a month.
00:49:58 Speaker 2 And will those medication errors be documented in a reference letter, or would you be aware of?
00:50:04 Speaker 2 Like that, the Meadow Park and the.
00:50:06 Speaker 2 Would be aware of the reason why you.
00:50:08 Speaker 2 Were let go.
00:50:09 Speaker 1 I told the person that hired me at Meadow Park. She told me she had found my resume somewhere because I never fly to Meadow Park, but she found my resume somewhere and she called me because I needed a nurse. So when we did, our interview name was Heather. Forget about.
00:50:28 Speaker 1 And it's not there anymore. When we did our interview, she said to me, why did you leave? And I told her, I said, I'll be absolutely honest with you. I was tired from Metairie.
00:50:40 Speaker 1 And she said, well, tell me about them. And I did.
00:50:42 Speaker 1 And she said, OK, well, I believe in second chances. So you're hired full time afternoons and it was a one year contract.
00:50:52 Speaker 2 And how? How long have you unemployed for? Yeah.
00:50:58 Speaker 2 In which you commute back and forth and you're still living what's on.
00:51:00 Speaker 1 I still live in Woodstock in my community best support.
00:51:03 Speaker 2 For straight afternoons? Yeah, what would that?
00:51:06 Speaker 2 What are the hours for the straight afternoon?
00:51:09 Speaker 1 Either 630 no. Sorry. Either 2:30 to 10:30 or three.
00:51:13 Speaker 1 11.
00:51:14 Speaker 1 I'm not sure what you look.
00:51:16 Speaker 2 So when you got to Meadow Park, what was the difference as far as the workflow of the?
00:51:20 Speaker 2 Patients that you're responsible for.
00:51:22 Speaker 1 No different, extremely similar. The only difference was that the RPM would do the if there were dresses that had to be done at night, they do the dressings.
00:51:35 Speaker 1 The people at night that reminds people.
00:51:37 Speaker 2 OK.
00:51:37 Speaker 1 But a little other than that, yeah, and.
00:51:43 Speaker 2 UM.
00:51:45 Speaker 2 Your supervisor supervisor at.
00:51:47 Speaker 2 That point I have no problem with. Everything was.
00:51:49 Speaker 2 That hired you.
00:51:49 Speaker 1 Heather or yeah.
00:51:53 Right.
00:51:56 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:52:01 Speaker 2 So our pad or?
00:52:04 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:52:06 Speaker 1 He was mean. He would grab the.
00:52:09 Speaker 1 Nurses and the.
00:52:11 Speaker 1 NCSW whenever they were trying to do things for me, he would grab them. He would twist their arms, he would punch them. Very difficult to do care for.
00:52:20 Speaker 1 And.
00:52:22 Speaker 1 One night I just got that surgery like that that you need to go.
00:52:26 Speaker 2 Have you done something on me?
00:52:28 Speaker 1 No, not really. Just been his normal self and he thought he thought the first needle.
00:52:34 Speaker 1 And then.
00:52:37 Speaker 1 That's so good. Need to worry about him. And I forgot something about Maureen. I had given her a dose of.
00:52:46 Speaker 1 Whatever we dosed her with to calm her down before I ever gave her the insulin. Forgot about that. But is that in there?
00:52:53 Speaker 2 See you right.
00:53:03 Speaker 1 And given our sedative, just before I ever gave any.
00:53:11 Speaker 2 Oh, you did? Yeah.
00:53:12 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:53:13 Speaker 2 Yeah.
00:53:15 Speaker 2 You're all doing.
00:53:16 Speaker 2 That.
00:53:19 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:53:21 Speaker 2 Did it come? Did the how it all?
00:53:22 Speaker 2 Come.
00:53:27 Speaker 1 The art I gave a large amount of short acting, large amount of long acting and between each other and then I when I left for the night he was still OK. When I came back the next day and worked, it said that he had had a stroke.
00:53:44 Speaker 1 Severe stroke and gone to the hospital.
00:53:47 Speaker 1 And the nurse that I talked to who's been on the night before, she said to you how low blood sugar was. And I said hello. And she said, oh, like one point something. And then and then she said, you know what? I went home and I did some research. Research. Sometimes having a bad stroke to make your blood sugar go up. Yeah.
00:54:06 Speaker 1 That's what she said to me.
00:54:11 Speaker 1 Yeah, that was odd.
00:54:13 Speaker 1 But yeah, so he lived for a couple of days and.
00:54:15 Speaker 2 Then he passed. You remember what you wished with.
00:54:19 Speaker 1 It was a nightmare.
00:54:22 Speaker 1 Was just short to attain the lady.
00:54:28 Speaker 2 OK.
00:54:30 Speaker 2 And do you remember what time of the night that you had?
00:54:32 Speaker 1 Injected her. I'm going to say 7:30 and then 9:30.
00:54:39 Speaker 2 And his reaction to it?
00:54:43 Speaker 1 He thought it, yeah, 85. 
00:00:00 Speaker 1 And helped me to really clarify the fact, but no, it wasn't God, it was something wrong with me psychologically that was making me believe that it was God.
00:00:10 Speaker 2 Would you ever, when you were doing this where ever did?
00:00:11 And.
00:00:12 Speaker 2 You ever speak?
00:00:13 Speaker 2 To these people, when you're injecting them.
00:00:16 Speaker 2 Anything to them?
00:00:17 Speaker 1 Not much. They asked me what I was doing and I disabled it.
00:00:21 Speaker 2 So having that and let's document in here a few times, having that feeling of anger and frustration.
00:00:28 Speaker 2 Would you ever? No, you would never.
00:00:31 Speaker 2 State anything to.
00:00:33 Speaker 2 Localize your your anger towards that person as you're injecting.
00:00:36 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:00:39 Speaker 2 And are then. Where did you injection?
00:00:44 Speaker 1 Iron.
00:00:45 Speaker 1 And side.
00:00:47 Speaker 2 And what were you telling me at?
00:00:48 Speaker 2 That point you were giving video.
00:00:50 Speaker 1 It's kind of, but then I need to.
00:00:52 Speaker 1 Have your medicine.
00:00:56 Speaker 1 And eventually.
00:01:00 Speaker 2 And was there an immediate reaction to him?
00:01:03 Speaker 2 At all that he.
00:01:05 Speaker 2 East Strawberry way.
00:01:06 Speaker 1 No, you didn't throw toilet.
00:01:10 Speaker 2 And then that's where you came in.
00:01:12 Speaker 2 The next and have the conversation with us or.
00:01:14 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah.
00:01:14 Speaker 2 Philippine on this.
00:01:22 Speaker 2 The four or five days.
00:01:23 Speaker 2 Later, where you passed away and you remember that was back at Meadow.
00:01:26 Speaker 1 Park it may have just been two or three days.
00:01:28 Speaker 2 He never came back.
00:01:33 Speaker 1 And his family was devastated. Absolutely done.
00:01:38 Speaker 2 What was his?
00:01:39 Speaker 2 Help like at that point.
00:01:41 Speaker 2 Prior to rejecting it.
00:01:41 Speaker 1 Other than other than dementia, he is fairly strong.
00:01:45 Speaker 1 He's in a wheelchair, but he's a good eater and he's drawn and.
00:01:52 Speaker 1 I'm going to say maybe 78.
00:01:56 Speaker 2 And do with his family members.
00:01:58 Speaker 1 He had a son named Art.
00:02:00 Speaker 1 To understand the comedy.
00:02:03 Speaker 1 Yeah. Like I I think it's just like a magnet for. And then his his wife.
00:02:13 Speaker 1 That's all I remember. I know you had other business.
00:02:17 Speaker 2 Do you remember if there were?
00:02:19 Speaker 2 Other.
00:02:21 Speaker 2 Son or daughters?
00:02:21 Speaker 2 Or this other family members that you could rule.
00:02:23 Speaker 1 There are other family members involved with the.
00:02:28 Umm.
00:02:34 Speaker 2 Did you ever have any interaction with his family when you said they were devastated? When did you?
00:02:39 Speaker 2 Learn of that. How did you know about that?
00:02:39 Speaker 1 Well, they came in to take the stuff out of this room.
00:02:42 Speaker 2 Following his death.
00:02:43 Speaker 1 While he was still in the hospital, they came then in the 5th and stuff and then when he was gone they came in to take the rest.
00:02:52 Speaker 2 How did you feel having a conversation with them? Awful.
00:02:59 Speaker 1 Again, they could be trading them.
00:03:09 Speaker 2 How you feeling right now?
00:03:12 Speaker 1 We're back from the I know we're almost done.
00:03:13 Speaker 3 Yeah, yeah.
00:03:15 Speaker 3 Yeah, I've got the seven times.
00:03:19 Speaker 1 Alright.
00:03:47 Speaker 3 We're getting there.
00:03:50 Speaker 3 I have 714.
00:03:54 Speaker 2 To renew.
00:04:03 Speaker 2 So we left that left off with art at the metal parts nursing home and we have a part of the metal parties in London, right? Right.
00:04:13 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:04:16 Speaker 2 Is there anything else you remember about our zone?
00:04:19 Speaker 1 Not really. Well, he was a big game hunter and he had pictures at all of this.
00:04:22 Speaker 3 Yeah.
00:04:26 Speaker 2 Did you ever converse with these people like what they did for work? And that same?
00:04:29 Speaker 2 Thing like would you remember details like that?
00:04:31 Speaker 2 Like art.
00:04:32 Speaker 1 Well, our is a big game hunter.
00:04:34 Speaker 1 Maurice I don't know, James. I don't know. No, I just never really did.
00:04:41 Speaker 2 And at Meadow Park, where would you inflate? Yeah.
00:04:46 Speaker 1 Again, from the from the medication fridge, from using experience new.
00:04:52 Speaker 2 And again while you try.
00:04:56 Speaker 3 Why is that?
00:04:59 Speaker 1 Answer is not something that's usually.
00:05:04 Speaker 2 And just because it's not a concern to the.
00:05:08 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:05:10 Speaker 1 I mean, I think it is.
00:05:10 Speaker 1 Now.
00:05:12 Speaker 1 I have some homes. Track it now.
00:05:17 Speaker 2 Just a question out of curiosity.
00:05:20 Speaker 2 My larger knowledge of.
00:05:23 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:05:27 Speaker 2 Now you have a portion of your on the fourth page of this document that you wrote out and before you. Then when did you write this out? I know.
00:05:34 Speaker 2 What dated the?
00:05:35 Speaker 2 24th of September.
00:05:38 Speaker 2 You wrote this full document at that point.
00:05:40 Speaker 1 24th and 20.
00:05:41 Speaker 1 5th.
00:05:41 Speaker 2 Where were you on that one?
00:05:43 Speaker 1 I was at the the Cambridge.
00:05:46 Speaker 2 And what made you prepare this argument?
00:05:49 Speaker 1 The doctor suggested to me that I should.
00:05:52 Speaker 1 Not not to give to the police, but he said he says that if I wrote it out, it would be a good part of my therapy. So and did take a large amount of pressure off me.
00:06:03 Speaker 1 And help me to really clarify the fact, but no, it wasn't God, it was something wrong with me psychologically that was making me believe that it was God.
00:06:13 Speaker 1 It really helped me to clarify that.
00:06:19 Speaker 2 And the original of this document.
00:06:21 Speaker 1 Is in my.
00:06:24 Speaker 1 Knapsack in the back of your car.
00:06:27 Speaker 2 And we'll get, we'll, we'll get down to that point, but it is providing us with the original.
00:06:31 Speaker 2 Document something you'd be.
00:06:32 Speaker 2 Willing to do.
00:06:33 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:06:35 Speaker 2 And we'll get to that.
00:06:37 Speaker 1 Do you have a stamp that you can stamp?
00:06:39 Speaker 1 It as the original.
00:06:43 Speaker 2 I don't even think we.
00:06:43 Speaker 2 Need to do that? We'll have to do that.
00:06:47 Speaker 1 OK.
00:06:53 Speaker 2 You have of course on the fourth page here entitled people who didn't die. So can you tell me about?
00:07:00 Speaker 1 OK, Cliff shoes. First person I ever gave extra insulin to. I think I gave her 40 and I just again, there was that surging, but it wasn't so much that I wanted to die. It was more of. Let's see what happened.
00:07:17 Speaker 1 And I get it sent to her on more than one occasion, albino was.
00:07:21 Speaker 1 OK.
00:07:22 Speaker 2 And sorry, she was prior to Mr. Silcox. Yeah. So this was the very first person that you injected with insulin. And we're at Crescent care. And her room was where?
00:07:26 Speaker 1 Yeah. Yes.
00:07:33 Speaker 1 Her room is in the east wing.
00:07:36 Speaker 1 Second door on the left.
00:07:38 Speaker 1 And then East swing the first door and left. Was your sister Alvina? She was diabetic.
00:07:43 Speaker 2 OK.
00:07:44 Speaker 1 She was October 2007, 2000. Until then, albino our sisters here.
00:07:46 Speaker 2 Sorry, that was your sister.
00:07:51 Speaker 1 Then there was Wayne. He was on the north wings. He was he had dementia. He was diabetic. He could be had cooperative.
00:08:02 Speaker 1 And I gave them a large overdose.
00:08:06 Speaker 1 UM.
00:08:08 Speaker 1 Because I thought it was just turned it off. That was lame, really.
00:08:10 Speaker 2 Done with Wayne.
00:08:12 Speaker 2 And sorry, how old was sorry. And I hate to go back. I just have a.
00:08:16 Speaker 2 Few more questions. How old was?
00:08:18 Speaker 1 Hilda was 90 years old. Albino was probably 8082.
00:08:24 Speaker 2 And did they have family that would come and visit?
00:08:27 Speaker 2 Yes, very much so. I'll be very welcome.
00:08:30 Speaker 1 Matilda, I think it was her daughters, and Albina was her husband.
00:08:36 Speaker 2 And long acting and short acting.
00:08:39 Speaker 1 Sure, not at that point.
00:08:41 Speaker 2 You know, Stephen, you're still doing.
00:08:42 Speaker 2 Short acting.
00:08:43 Speaker 2 Do you remember the dose? If you would have given?
00:08:44 Speaker 1 Oh, wait a second.
00:08:46 Speaker 1 What would they get at night? It was long acting, so it was what they thought at night. With those two, it was their own insulin. This extra jug, so probably 20 to 30 to 4030 to 40 extra.
00:09:02 Speaker 2 And then, Wayne, how old is Wayne St.
00:09:03 Speaker 1 I'd say 60.
00:09:05 Speaker 2 OK, so he was younger.
00:09:06 Speaker 1 He yeah, he had developed mentally developmental challenges as well as dementia, as well as being diabetic.
00:09:14 Speaker 1 And.
00:09:16 Speaker 1 Love being handful.
00:09:21 Speaker 1 And.
00:09:22 Speaker 1 He wanted to die, so again, that one night I just felt that surging and.
00:09:28 Speaker 1 But he didn't die. I think he would say it sometime.
00:09:29 Speaker 2 How would you know you wanted to die?
00:09:34 Speaker 1 That you missed going to go where was when?
00:09:37 Speaker 1 He was in Room 8, which is the main floor down at the end.
00:09:41 Speaker 2 So it's 8 or is the number.
00:09:43 Speaker 1 888 Now 8-9.
00:09:47 Speaker 2 And would that be roommates in there?
00:09:49 Speaker 1 As well, yes.
00:09:51 Speaker 2 Do you know who he is?
00:09:57 Speaker 2 All right. And Mike, with hunting meetings please?
00:10:00 Speaker 1 That was 2009.
00:10:01 Speaker 2 What is that movie?
00:10:03 Speaker 1 It robs you of your body and you still have your mind. You get progressively more agitated. You get progressively more.
00:10:13 Speaker 1 Psychotic and your new wheelchair and you've got all these movements that you.
00:10:17 Speaker 1 Can't control. Horrible.
00:10:19 Speaker 2 How old is Mike?
00:10:20 Speaker 1 He was 54.
00:10:23 Speaker 1 And again, one night I just felt that searching and I thought now this must be God, because this man is not enjoying his life at all. Though I gave him a large amount of insulin. I think I gave him 90 total.
00:10:39 Speaker 2 Did you ever do anything to hernia and?
00:10:41 Speaker 1 No, no.
00:10:42 Speaker 2 To win.
00:10:43 Speaker 1 No, no.
00:10:47 Speaker 1 No.
00:10:52 Speaker 2 This takes us to a different location until we're placing Paris, that's obviously Paris ON correct outside of Branford with doctorate.
00:10:57 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:11:00 Speaker 1 2016 winter. Yeah, and I was.
00:11:02 Speaker 2 OK. And that was Sandra. Hello, Sandra.
00:11:05 Speaker 1 Sandra, I think she was in her 70s.
00:11:10 Speaker 2 And.
00:11:11 Speaker 2 Tougher place. What? What was the breakup of the rooms there?
00:11:14 Speaker 2 Where was she located on tougher plane?
00:11:15 Speaker 1 She was she was down, the wind, straight down from the nursing desk about two doors on the left.
00:11:25 Speaker 1 And she had three roommates.
00:11:28 Speaker 2 She described her a little bit of personality.
00:11:31 Speaker 1 And her tall.
00:11:34 Speaker 1 Not very well, she.
00:11:35 Speaker 1 Didn't walk anymore. She had a good sense of humor.
00:11:41 Speaker 1 She often said she didn't want to be there.
00:11:46 Speaker 1 And so one night I came for my I.
00:11:49 Speaker 1 Think someone over at all.
00:11:53 Speaker 1 But she survived because the nurses came on.
00:11:56 Speaker 1 Neck.
00:11:58 Speaker 1 Went to check on her to do something else and noticed that she was sweating and does her blood sugar and save her.
00:12:07 Speaker 2 And how these other people survive?
00:12:09 Speaker 1 It just didn't. Oh, for Tilda and Davina, they found them to have short bloods. They found them to have low blood sugar, and they gave them substrate it. And when the mice they just survived.
00:12:21 Speaker 1 Was never found out.
00:12:24 Speaker 2 Was there anything to do with the gender?
00:12:26 Speaker 2 Male or female, that is included.
00:12:29 Speaker 2 The effect of it or is?
00:12:30 Speaker 2 It just again just dependent on the make of the body and the health and the.
00:12:31 Speaker 1 Right.
00:12:33 Speaker 1 Yeah, not that I know this hasn't been.
00:12:41 Speaker 2 The nurse who saved Sandra.
00:12:44 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:12:45 Speaker 2 Was there anything that ever came back on you? You know, any retribution consequences?
00:12:51 Speaker 1 No.
00:12:56 Speaker 1 He even asked me about it. Not if I thought you'd done everything.
00:13:00 Speaker 2 Who listens to you?
00:13:02 Speaker 1 Diane, I don't remember her last name.
00:13:06 Speaker 2 And what we're working on that point was just.
00:13:08 Speaker 2 Really. Hand over please.
00:13:10 Speaker 1 Whatever I got called in for, I was actually working for a nursing agency at that time called lifeguard agency, and I was sent to health service lifeguards.
00:13:21 Speaker 2 So you were never employed by 12 in place?
00:13:23 Speaker 1 No, not as employed by lifeguard, and I would go to tell for and two other.
00:13:27 Speaker 1 Places as well.
00:13:31 Speaker 2 And that's when you got involved with.
00:13:33 Speaker 2 That it was worried you would like.
00:13:34 Speaker 1 Yeah. Yeah, just.
00:13:37 Speaker 1 I was only with family. This is this like a month.
00:13:40 Speaker 1 And a half before I quit.
00:13:44 Speaker 2 2016 of August, which was not too long.
00:13:47 Speaker 2 Ago and you're.
00:13:48 Speaker 2 Employed with Saint Elizabeth, it says here.
00:13:50 Speaker 1 Yeah, I was frustrated with my job.
00:13:53 Speaker 1 Had a huge.
00:13:56 Speaker 1 Huge workload. Having to learn a lot of new things, just a lot of frustration. The weekend that this happened there I had all, all of the people that I had looked after. Most of them were in Ingersoll. I didn't know any of them, and on the Saturday I went in and I.
00:14:17 Speaker 1 Was doing my care.
00:14:19 Speaker 1 And this is really the only one that was pre planned because on Saturday when, as in Karen Beverly, and noticed that she had a pick line which is line the tick medication.
00:14:29 Speaker 1 Straight to your.
00:14:30 Speaker 1 And that she was a diabetic. And so the next day, when I went in, I was really frustrated and I could just really feel the surging and the laughing. And I I gave her a huge amount. I gave her, I think it was 183, three doses of 62 to 69.
00:14:46 Speaker 2 Is any question not at all?
00:14:48 Speaker 1 No, because I was wondering if they're fine one to put into your eyes and about us and wondering if they're fine again.
00:14:54 Speaker 1 And she's arrived.
00:14:58 Speaker 1 The next day.
00:15:00 Speaker 1 No, but I was able to check it on my computer because she's seeing every day by a nurse like to go into tablets from work and see.
00:15:07 Speaker 1 How she goes?
00:15:09 Speaker 2 And that was just a computer program used by Elizabeth.
00:15:11 Speaker 1 Yeah, on their own tables.
00:15:14 Speaker 2 And these other people, where did you inject?
00:15:16 Speaker 2 Them.
00:15:17 Speaker 1 There are.
00:15:20 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:15:23 Speaker 1 Sandy was probably her leg, but she was a little bit more difficult.
00:15:29 Speaker 2 In August of of 2016, then with you don't remember Beverly.
00:15:33 Speaker 1 No, I don't. I don't remember.
00:15:34 Speaker 2 Question.
00:15:35 Speaker 1 Her first name was Beverly.
00:15:39 Speaker 1 I should probably.
00:15:42 Speaker 1 I don't know if I could tell you the weekend it was or not.
00:15:45 Speaker 2 She lived in Anderson.
00:15:47 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:15:47 Speaker 2 Did you live in a home or?
00:15:49 Speaker 1 Yeah, in a home like.
00:15:51 Speaker 2 Their own residence, living or.
00:16:08 Speaker 2 Do you remember where you saw?
00:16:09 Speaker 1 It was no, I don't.
00:16:13 Speaker 2 How can you have any named Beverly? But you're not sure what her name is?
00:16:16 Speaker 1 Because I'm not sure.
00:16:17 Speaker 1 If it was Bev or Bev or.
00:16:20 Speaker 2 I got you.
00:16:22 Speaker 2 And that was.
00:16:24 Speaker 2 The only one you've given through their plane.
00:16:26 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:16:27 Speaker 2 Did you know what?
00:16:27 Speaker 2 The result would be compared to a direct injection into an arm or leg or.
00:16:30 Speaker 2 A thigh headlight.
00:16:31 Speaker 1 I've never done it before and never looked at it. I had no idea she wanted. She went to sleep fairly quickly and then left, but when I checked the next day to see how she was through the next nurse.
00:16:45 Speaker 1 There is no change.
00:16:46 Speaker 2 How old is she?
00:16:48 Speaker 1 She won.
00:16:51 Speaker 1 6364.
00:16:55 Speaker 2 And what was?
00:16:56 Speaker 2 Her diagnosis, as far as her gone.
00:16:59 Speaker 1 She was diabetic and she had large ulcers on her leg.
00:17:04 Speaker 1 And she also had a.
00:17:07 Speaker 1 Severe infection.
00:17:14 Speaker 2 How's that make you feel controlled there?
00:17:22 Speaker 2 Do you feel like there's a burden on?
00:17:23 Doctor.
00:17:23 Speaker 2 Silvers. Yeah.
00:17:25 Speaker 1 I've done the right thing.
00:17:29 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:17:30 Speaker 1 And now I know that it wasn't God.
00:17:32 Speaker 1 And I'm ashamed of myself that that happens. But I also think that it was mental health.
00:17:39 Speaker 1 Yeah. I'd like to look files in.
00:17:41 Speaker 1 My right mind.
00:17:43 Speaker 1 Or I would have been able to tell.
00:17:44 Speaker 1 Them.
00:17:44 Speaker 1 And who I was raised to believe in God, I was raised from my baby to the to Sunday school. So how could?
00:17:50 Speaker 1 I get such a strong feeling.
00:17:52 Speaker 1 That this is what goes wrong is unless it was something wrong with my head.
00:18:00 Speaker 2 And always talk to those what you would say to the families and and so on and so forth.
00:18:07 Speaker 2 Again, I I I feel terrible for the for the people that are going to find out and in the days and weeks to come about what actually happened to their loved ones, right?
00:18:21 Speaker 1 If there was ever anything I could do so that nobody did this again, I'd do it.
00:18:32 Speaker 2 Just a few other things to cover often.
00:18:39 Speaker 2 The things that some of these people would do.
00:18:41 Speaker 2 To you hitting the pinching, the grabbing of your breasts.
00:18:46 Speaker 2 Would you ever report?
00:18:46 Speaker 1 That, yeah, but.
00:18:48 Speaker 1 Yeah, it was always reported in charge of them.
00:18:50 Speaker 2 And that's document other Hertz. OK. And was there any? There's obviously you never obviously, but was there ever any charges or criminal matters that came up any of this at all?
00:18:51 Yes.
00:19:00 Speaker 1 No.
00:19:02 Speaker 1 Best part of working in the.
00:19:03 Speaker 1 Nursing home that this what?
00:19:05 Speaker 1 They do, might even be your fault there.
00:19:09 Speaker 1 This is Tom Lang, yeah.
00:19:13 Speaker 2 Do you think that?
00:19:14 Speaker 2 Playing with played a role in your actions.
00:19:17 Speaker 1 No.
00:19:24 Speaker 2 Maureen, your ex?
00:19:36 Speaker 2 When the last time you talked to her.
00:19:39 Speaker 1 Think about what, four years ago, when do all.
00:19:41 Speaker 1 The money to move back.
00:19:43 Speaker 1 We were only together for a year.
00:19:45 Speaker 2 So she came here from.
00:19:47 Speaker 1 Yeah. You had two kids.
00:19:51 Speaker 2 The issue.
00:19:52 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:19:58 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:20:03 Speaker 2 When they were here.
00:20:07 Speaker 3 Have you?
00:20:09 Speaker 2 This document is used prepared best.
00:20:13 Speaker 2 And I know that you had stated.
00:20:15 Speaker 2 The reason why?
00:20:18 Speaker 2 This is called the breaking point of why you stopped.
00:20:20 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:20:21 Speaker 2 What is the possibility that you're going to have?
00:20:23 Speaker 2 To be dealing with.
00:20:24 Speaker 2 Yes, that's right. Right. Yeah. Is there anyone else?
00:20:29 Speaker 2 Within your career path that isn't listed on these four documents or these.
00:20:33 Speaker 2 Four pieces of liquid.
00:20:37 Speaker 2 That you'd be responsible for the deaths.
00:20:38 Speaker 1 No, absolutely not.
00:20:41 Speaker 2 And if we were to tell you that.
00:20:44 Speaker 2 We've come across some fairly significant or suspicious.
00:20:49 Speaker 2 Deaths at other nursing homes.
00:20:52 Speaker 1 Where it's in right? What would you say tonight?
00:20:54 Speaker 1 And stay with me.
00:20:58 Speaker 2 So there's no one else involved, no.
00:21:02 Speaker 2 That was fell victim to your actions.
00:21:11 Speaker 2 Just repeat to.
00:21:12 Speaker 2 Me again. The people that you've disclosed this.
00:21:13 Speaker 2 To beside myself.
00:21:14 Speaker 2 Tonight, OK.
00:21:17 Speaker 1 The very first.
00:21:18 Speaker 1 Person I ever disclosed it to was another girlfriend at the time her name was.
00:21:26 Speaker 1 That was after I cooked a couple of people and.
00:21:29 Speaker 1 She told me not to do it again, that she.
00:21:31 Speaker 1 Was going to.
00:21:32 Speaker 1 Turn me into the police.
00:21:36 Speaker 1 In 2008, I think.
00:21:40 Speaker 1 And then 2011.
00:21:43 Speaker 1 When I decided to stop killing my friend.
00:21:48 Speaker 1 I told her what I've been doing and that I had stopped.
00:21:52 Speaker 1 And then.
00:21:54 Speaker 1 I told my pastor.
00:21:57 Speaker 1 And then after that, I told the in two.
00:22:00 Speaker 1 1014.
00:22:02 Speaker 1 After I passed away, I went on a holiday and.
00:22:08 Speaker 1 That's when I really decided that this had stopped, and so I told.
00:22:15 Speaker 1 A friend and heredity.
00:22:20 Speaker 1 Then.
00:22:22 Speaker 1 I told when I came back I got a good to the lawyer.
00:22:28 Speaker 1 And then while I was in the Toronto, it was in Cam H.
00:22:34 Speaker 1 Well, I told my friend before everyone I've told my cousin.
00:22:38 Speaker 1 I told my friend.
00:22:40 Speaker 1 And I told my friend.
00:22:43 Speaker 1 And then while I was in campaign, which I told them someone who I thought was a friend.
00:22:50 Speaker 1 They turned around and called the police to make sure that it has really been dealt with.
00:22:54 Speaker 1 And I understand that he thought he was doing the right thing. I understand that. But he had said I won't tell anybody. And as you didn't him as a resource for support and he turned around when I was when?
00:23:07 Speaker 1 I had already you.
00:23:08 Speaker 1 Know I'd already shared it, so why would he call the police?
00:23:11 Speaker 2 So why do you think that none of these people confronted police?
00:23:15 Speaker 1 Maybe they didn't believe me.
00:23:18 Speaker 1 I don't know.
00:23:19 Speaker 1 Maybe they just thought maybe they thought it was June. March.
00:23:23 Speaker 1 Something that the patient wanted done.
00:23:28 Speaker 2 And as far as believing you are these close people to you that you've shared other.
00:23:32 Speaker 2 Deep dark sequences? Maybe overtime.
00:23:34 Speaker 1 I I would say.
00:23:37 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:23:38 Speaker 2 Because this is a pretty serious thing.
00:23:40 Speaker 1 Yes, it is very normal.
00:23:43 Speaker 1 It's the worst thing.
00:23:46 Speaker 2 Telling these people and then just.
00:23:48 Speaker 2 Find it hard to believe that no one would come forward until.
00:23:53 Speaker 2 5-6 people down the.
00:23:54 Speaker 2 Road, right? Yeah, having knowledge of.
00:23:56 Speaker 1 It. Yeah, I hear you.
00:24:01 Speaker 2 And everything that you're telling us the truth.
00:24:04 Speaker 2 There's nothing that's been fabricated.
00:24:13 Speaker 2 What we find in your home, did you?
00:24:14 Speaker 2 Ever document any of this activity at all?
00:24:17 Speaker 1 Once in a while I draw I journaled on it and it might. There might be some in my home, but I don't know. I think it should, if if it's around it will be in like a viral binder.
00:24:23 Speaker 2 Those.
00:24:31 Speaker 1 In either my desk, my other desk.
00:24:35 Speaker 1 For my for my.
00:24:39 Speaker 1 Which we'll call it.
00:24:42 Come on.
00:24:43 Speaker 1 The file files folders in the Yes filing cabinet.
00:24:48 Speaker 1 You know.
00:24:50 Speaker 2 Do you live alone?
00:24:52 Speaker 1 Yes, I did.
00:24:53 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:24:56 Speaker 1 Did you want someone to come with me or not?
00:24:58 Speaker 2 Well, it's gone through the.
00:24:59 Speaker 2 As part of the investigation, has already been charged for.
00:25:01 Speaker 2 An execute that address.
00:25:05 Speaker 2 I don't know.
00:25:06 Speaker 2 Because we've been conversing for quite some time.
00:25:08 Speaker 1 OK.
00:25:10 Speaker 2 OK, I'm just asking.
00:25:13 Speaker 2 Because you've been so cooperative and and again, I do appreciate that. I really do. It just makes things a lot easier, right?
00:25:23 Speaker 2 Advising us where certain things might be, and you said you might have thrown them out, yeah.
00:25:26 Speaker 1 You might not have. I might not have had them. And then at the very end of my coffee table, there's a box and got pictures and a photo of the minutes. There might be something in there too, of a trailer queue.
00:25:40 Speaker 3 Good evening.
00:25:46 Speaker 1 Writing path.
00:25:49 Speaker 2 What types of things, what types of things would?
00:25:51 Speaker 1 You document. That's what I've done. Have that I felt.
00:25:55 Speaker 1 When it happened, just trying to figure out what was going on.
00:25:57 Speaker 1 In my head.
00:25:59 Speaker 2 Searching for answers.
00:26:00 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:26:02 Speaker 2 They're not sure you.
00:26:04 Speaker 2 Rid of those around there.
00:26:06 Speaker 1 I thought I got rid of them all, but I don't know if I did for sure.
00:26:11 Speaker 2 Would there be anything?
00:26:12 Speaker 2 Else, as far as computer documents.
00:26:15 Speaker 1 There would be.
00:26:17 Speaker 1 I accessed the computer support group for.
00:26:21 Speaker 1 Borderline personality disorder. It would be on that. It would be on that website.
00:26:27 Speaker 2 It's just an open forum that you could join and post comments and.
00:26:30 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:26:32 Speaker 2 What website is that?
00:26:34 Speaker 1 I couldn't tell you, but I could find you.
00:26:35 Speaker 1 On my computer.
00:26:37 Speaker 2 And would that be something that you'd be willing to share with us? Give us good time to talk and whatnot.
00:26:39 Speaker 1 A question.
00:26:41 Speaker 1 Yep.
00:26:47 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:26:49 Speaker 3 What's your tattoo? Hopefully.
00:26:53 Speaker 1 Then I have.
00:26:54 Speaker 1 Hopes for the future and dreams of the future.
00:26:59 Speaker 2 After the last year.
00:27:02 Speaker 1 That somehow some way I can help somebody.
00:27:05 Speaker 1 There's got to be somebody wherever I go. Jail penitentiary. There's got to be somebody I can help. Maybe somebody who can't read. Maybe somebody who can't write. Maybe somebody has done more than me and feels like it will never be.
00:27:18 Speaker 1 Forgiven.
00:27:19 Speaker 1 Maybe somebody who's done listen me, who feels.
00:27:20 Speaker 1 Like it will never be forgiven.
00:27:22 Speaker 1 There's got to be something that can come from this. Maybe somebody can study me and come up with answers and new medication. So this doesn't happen again.
00:27:33 Speaker 1 That's metal.
00:27:36 Speaker 2 Is there anything worse than taking?
00:27:38 Speaker 2 The loss of life.
00:27:41 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:27:43 Speaker 1 Sheldon child molestation.
00:27:47 Speaker 1 Absolutely.
00:27:48 Speaker 2 You feel that you might.
00:27:50 Speaker 2 Harm your children yourself if you were.
00:27:52 Speaker 1 To work with them, I was afraid that that they might get that feeling of wanting to give them into one wanted Joseph specially since they were that diabetic and I just I panicked and there was no way absolutely not open to that.
00:28:11 Speaker 2 Is there anything else that you?
00:28:12 Speaker 2 Can think of right now, no.
00:28:13 Speaker 1 No.

00:28:31 Speaker 2 With that, we discussed your.
00:28:31 Speaker 1 OK.
00:28:37 Speaker 2 Original document that's in your backpack. If I were to prepare a form, which is the consent to search or the consent form to provide us with those arguments, would that?

00:28:59 Speaker 1 So you start.
00:29:00 Speaker 1 At what you did and you go backwards to how you're feeling, what you could have done different and all that.
00:29:05 Speaker 2 Do you feel?
00:29:06 Speaker 2 That your time man can be trusted and.
00:29:09 Speaker 2 You received a fairly.

00:30:34 Speaker 1 OK.
00:30:39 Speaker 2 So First off, a few things that and you remember the gentleman who transporters back from Toronto and also Karen, my partners that they've just been monitoring and.
00:30:52 Speaker 1 Great. Great.
00:30:52 Speaker 2 Needs and also.
00:30:53 Speaker 2 Things like just some things that are are concerning and that we just need.
00:30:56 Speaker 2 To firm up, hopefully.
00:30:57 Speaker 1 OK.
00:30:59 Speaker 2 So First off, as I said, there has been a search for next two days written ones and there was some paperwork with regards to a Remington.
00:31:03 Speaker 1 OK.
00:31:08 Speaker 2 Got shot, kind of some sort. Oh, like, what would that be for?
00:31:14 Speaker 1 I like guns.
00:31:15 Speaker 2 OK. Yeah. All right. Do you have any?
00:31:17 Speaker 1 No, no, no.
00:31:19 Speaker 1 I used to. I had a 22.
00:31:20 Speaker 2 Did you work?
00:31:24 Speaker 2 Was there anything by chance?
00:31:25 Speaker 1 Not that I know of.
00:31:28 Speaker 1 But my.
00:31:31 Speaker 1 My husband had a gun that his dad gave me that we would shoot with so I could stay at the at the.
00:31:40 Speaker 1 I could stay at the gun close and shoot and when we broke up, I did the paperwork to give the bathroom.
00:31:51 Speaker 1 That might be.
00:31:53 Speaker 1 What they found.
00:31:54 Speaker 1 OK.
00:31:55 Speaker 2 But there's there's no partners in the house right now.
00:31:57 Speaker 1 No, Sir, no, never will be.

00:32:21 Speaker 1 You know, it had been sitting down the computer, remember?
00:32:25 Speaker 1 And even the funds supporters.
00:32:31 Speaker 2 These are a bunch of random questions. It's all.
00:32:32 Speaker 2 Thrown together here the insulin.
00:32:35 Speaker 2 That used the short acting long acting, their actual brand or make of the insulin that.
00:32:42 Speaker 2 You use.

00:32:50 Speaker 1 Can't remember.
00:32:57 Speaker 2 When you worked with lifeguarding, I know that you'd mentioned they'd send you to certain locations and certain homes. What were not there was tougher placement. There's two others.
00:33:05 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:33:09 Speaker 1 Although there is more than.
00:33:13 Speaker 1 There was Telfer place.
00:33:16 Speaker 1 That was the very first. Then there was.
00:33:21 Oh.
00:33:22 Speaker 1 Yeah, the one here southford place.
00:33:26 Speaker 1 Fort Dover, Dover Cliff. What it was called. I did one piece. We shifted a place in New Hamburg. But I can tell you the name of it.
00:33:38 Speaker 1 Also, I worked at.
00:33:42 Speaker 1 Ah.
00:33:44 Speaker 1 Tougher place and Dover cliffs are both owned by the same people and they have another nursing home in Branford.
00:33:55 Speaker 1 But I can't remember the name of it.
00:33:58 Speaker 1 And then and then Park Lane Terrace in Paris.
00:33:58 Speaker 3 Computer.
00:34:04 Speaker 1 And Hardy terrace.
00:34:07 Speaker 1 I think it's outside of her.
00:34:10 Speaker 1 Ohh and what was the other one called?
00:34:14 Speaker 1 Oh Lord.
00:34:17 Speaker 1 It's Weaver and towns like Marin Half Drive from here.

00:35:00 Speaker 2 Does your work as a pediatric nurse?
00:35:02 Speaker 1 Oh, then I was.
00:35:03 Speaker 1 Going to be working with the kids, yes.

00:36:29 Speaker 1 From from present here.
00:36:35 Speaker 1 I told her after I had stopped the first time.
00:36:38 Speaker 1 And she felt being my friend.
00:36:42 Speaker 1 And.
00:36:59 Speaker 2 Where does she work?

00:37:09 Speaker 1 She lives in Toronto.
00:37:15 Speaker 3 OK.
00:37:19 Speaker 2 We're going to wrap things up, but.
00:37:23 Speaker 2 Here's what's here's what's going to happen, OK?
00:37:26 Speaker 2 And part of.
00:37:26 Speaker 2 This is going to be.
00:37:27 Speaker 2 Up to you.
00:37:30 Speaker 2 What are your plans?
00:37:32 Speaker 2 Going forward from here, we were.
00:37:33 Going.
00:37:33 Speaker 1 Forward from here I want to go home. I want to have a good night's sleep. I want to spend Thanksgiving weekend with my family and they want to be available to the police and intend to meet me. And if I have to come back for trial, I have to come back for.
00:37:33 Speaker 2 To.
00:37:37 Speaker 2 OK.
00:37:49 Speaker 1 I have no plans of leaving. I can turn to my car if.
00:37:53 Speaker 1 You want me to?
00:37:55 Speaker 2 Are your parents? Are you close with your parents or what? Like the?
00:37:58 Speaker 1 Very, very, very close. I have to tell them tonight what's happened. Yes, they know that. They know that I've been in.
00:37:59 Speaker 2 Relationship you have with them.
00:38:08 Speaker 1 They know that I've been in the hospital but.
00:38:11 Speaker 1 That I just told them it was for treatment, but yeah, I planned today just to go and talk to them. one-on-one, like face to face and tell them they're going to be devastated.
00:38:20 Speaker 2 What do you think the reaction?
00:38:24 Speaker 1 I'm gonna. I'm gonna plan on staying. Staying the night there so they have access.
00:38:28 Speaker 1 To me.
00:38:29 Speaker 2 Work.
00:38:31 Speaker 1 Eventually all the support I need.
00:38:37 Speaker 1 I also plan to go to my AA groups I had planned on doing 90 meetings in 90 days.
00:38:45 Speaker 1 And just keep up with like I plan to.
00:38:49 Speaker 1 So one of the things that happens with me is I isolate and then I start to not do well. So I plan to.
00:38:54 Speaker 1 And do the Thanksgiving thing, keep up with my friends, climb clean my apartment. Tell my parents.
00:39:01 Speaker 1 Those are my plans. I have no plans to leave town.
00:39:05 Speaker 1 This is I've done this and I'm ready to face it, but.
00:39:09 Speaker 1 I would love to.
00:39:12 Speaker 2 I think that's going to happen.
00:39:14 Speaker 1 Last year, I think nothing happened.
00:39:17 Speaker 2 As I said at the very, very beginning of this.
00:39:20 Speaker 2 Whatever time we started to go hours ago.
00:39:25 Speaker 2 You're not under arrest right now. OK, but as you can imagine.
00:39:32 OK.
00:39:39 Speaker 1 Call you back in 30 minutes.
00:39:45 Speaker 2 Sure.
00:39:47 Speaker 2 As I said at the beginning, you're not under arrest, but as you can imagine, an investigation like this is something that we've never dealt with. It's something that doesn't happen very often, something that you rarely hear about, OK?
00:39:51 Speaker 1 I will be.
00:40:03 Speaker 2 I don't know of.
00:40:03 Speaker 2 Many, but you're not the first person to.
00:40:05 Speaker 2 Do this OK.
00:40:06 Right.
00:40:07 Speaker 2 Having said that.
00:40:08 Speaker 2 We have a responsibility to protect the public.
00:40:12 Speaker 2 Right, right. Coming from I say that you done some.
00:40:14 Speaker 1 Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
00:40:20 Speaker 2 Some things to some innocent people, some pretty. What people are not people are going to have opinions of you and these are going to exactly.
00:40:22 Speaker 1 Absolutely.
00:40:25 Speaker 1 Interesting.
00:40:28 Speaker 1 1/3.
00:40:33 Speaker 2 Having said that, there's something in the Criminal Court of Canada.
00:40:36 Speaker 2 And this is usually.
00:40:38 Speaker 2 Results in someone being charged with criminal offense and being placed on such a thing called an 810 kind of bond. OK? And basically what an 810 piece bond is is.
00:40:51 Speaker 2 Is kind of a promise given by you or your word given to us, and it's a court document issued by a judge.
00:40:58 Speaker 2 That puts you on a certain condition to a certain condition, limiting you from doing certain things. Having certain things in your possession, attending certain locations, and if you were to breach those conditions then you would be arrested and further charged with breaching this. What's called a 10 piece bond. So basically.
00:41:09 Speaker 1 Right.
00:41:12 Speaker 1 OK.
00:41:15 Speaker 1 OK.
00:41:17 Speaker 2 You've heard a restraint restraint order. It's similar to that. OK, a lot of people call them restraining orders, but it's actually in Canada called the 10:00 PM. And again, just limits you from doing certain things, attending certain locations.
00:41:19 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:41:25 Speaker 1 OK.
00:41:31 Speaker 2 It could be things like still getting help for your mental health, your substance abuse, straining your passport.
00:41:36 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:41:39 Speaker 1 I have no.
00:41:40 Speaker 2 Not practicing as an RN. Yeah. Another thing. Nursing homes, things like that. If that were an option which, like I said, usually that occurs with people that are charged. People are convicted of certain offenses. That's part of their their punishment. So that's.
00:41:44 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:41:53 Speaker 1 Right.
00:41:55 Speaker 1 OK.
00:41:57 Speaker 2 Would you be willing to enter into an 18 piece bond prior to being criminally charged?
00:42:02 Speaker 1 Absolutely.
00:42:04 Speaker 2 And do you understand what I?
00:42:05 Speaker 2 Mean by the SMP blocking all right.
00:42:06 Speaker 1 Yeah, yeah, it means I have to do it or I come back and I'm in jail until everything else.
00:42:13 Speaker 2 I don't know what would happen if you were to reach it as.
00:42:15 Speaker 2 Far as jail and the consequences?
00:42:18 Speaker 1 Yeah.
00:42:18 Speaker 2 The only thing that I want to make sure that it's clear to you and and that I'm make sure that.
00:42:22 Speaker 2 I'm getting my point across is that it's.
00:42:24 Speaker 2 Basically a document that you're going to.
00:42:25 Speaker 2 Swear to sign.
00:42:27 And.
00:42:29 Speaker 2 And agree not to be certain things, not that certain things in the position. And I would say, I'm not saying it's going to happen right now because it has to go in front of the judge. OK. So it's just an option that we're looking at because as I said, we have the responsibility.
00:42:31 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:42:35 Speaker 1 OK.
00:42:42 Speaker 2 To protect the.
00:42:42 Speaker 2 Public. OK, that's why I want to.
00:42:43 Speaker 1 Yes, absolutely.
00:42:45 Speaker 2 Know.
00:42:45 Speaker 2 What your plans are I want to.
00:42:46 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:42:46 Speaker 2 That you're going to.
00:42:47 Speaker 2 Go home and be supported by your family.
00:42:48 Speaker 1 Yes, Cilco will be charged at all times, always on my body. If you need me, I will be here. And if you need me to come here, I'll be here. If you need me to wait for you to come and get me, I'll do it. I'll totally committed.
00:42:49 Speaker 2 One in the lake, you're going to have.
00:43:05 Speaker 2 All right.
00:43:07 Speaker 2 I think we have.
00:43:07 Speaker 2 Your we have your cell phone number.
00:43:10 Speaker 1 519532.
00:43:14 Speaker 1 6471.
00:43:16 Speaker 2 OK.
00:43:16 Speaker 1 Home phone number is 519.
00:43:21 Speaker 1 290-0724.
00:43:25 Speaker 1 Parent phone number.
00:43:28 Speaker 2 Don't worry about that. When we get your parents moving both.
00:43:31 Speaker 1 OK.
00:43:34 Speaker 2 Do you understand what I?
00:43:36 Speaker 2 What we just talked about?
00:43:37 Speaker 1 Oh yeah, absolutely.
00:43:38 Speaker 2 This is a very unique situation, right for you? Confess to certain things and we have quite a bit of like work as you can imagine to keep this investigation together and see where we go from here. There's a lot of people will consult in it and.
00:43:40 Speaker 1 Yeah. So the same song.
00:43:47 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:43:52 Speaker 1 OK.
00:43:55 Speaker 2 Determine the final answer of what your phase is. OK, but I know that you're aware of the extent of what you've done. I know that you've verbalized and spoke about how you feel and that obviously you can't take it back, but.
00:43:58 Speaker 1 OK. All right.
00:44:04 Speaker 1 Yes.
00:44:12 Speaker 1 I'm relieved that I've confessed it.
00:44:14 Speaker 1 I feel sorry for the.
00:44:15 Speaker 1 People that are not going to find out.
00:44:17 Speaker 1 Sorry, didn't say it.
00:44:19 Speaker 1 Mission station demanded this whole word. Period.
00:44:23 Speaker 2 Like, I'm sorry or something. Yeah, no problem I've got.
00:44:27 Speaker 1 I really have to.
00:44:32 Speaker 2 816 and I think that will probably conclude.
00:44:34 Speaker 3 Things, but yeah.
00:44:39 Speaker 1 Yeah, no problem.
