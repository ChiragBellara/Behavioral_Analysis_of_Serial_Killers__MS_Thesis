723,Speaker 2,"And besides that, you.",2867.000,2868.000
724,Speaker 2,"Thought that this was the purpose that you.",2868.000,2870.000
725,Speaker 2,"Were.",2870.000,2870.000
726,Speaker 2,"Given on from your relationship forward after breaking up with your husband right, that you that you.",2870.000,2876.000

729,Speaker 2,"Is that?",2880.000,2881.000
730,Speaker 2,"A portion of what happens.",2881.000,2883.000
731,Speaker 1,"I don't know.",2883.000,2885.000
732,Speaker 1,"I wonder if that's a portion of how I chose him afterwards. I did feel a release and a release.",2885.000,2891.000
733,Speaker 1,"Like a release of pressure.",2891.000,2893.000
734,Speaker 2,"Because throughout this document and as we go through.",2893.000,2896.000
735,Speaker 2,"It a lot of these people.",2896.000,2899.000
736,Speaker 2,"You kind of described them as not very nice people. Yeah, right. Yeah. So I'm not sure if that's a tendency or a pattern that we see as far as. Is that why you told these people?",2899.000,2909.000
737,Speaker 1,"Yeah, I'm not. It might be, but I also know I just felt like they were the ones right. They just feeling as though that.",2909.000,2915.000
738,Speaker 1,"They were.",2915.000,2916.000
739,Speaker 2,"The one before before you.",2916.000,2919.000
740,Speaker 2,"Injected insulin in Mr. Silcox.",2919.000,2923.000
741,Speaker 2,"Was it a spur of the moment thing had?",2923.000,2925.000
742,Speaker 2,"You thought about it that when?",2925.000,2926.000
743,Speaker 2,"You reported for duty at.",2926.000,2927.000
744,Speaker 1,"3:00 in the afternoon, thinking about it, about 6:00 at night, I think.",2927.000,2939.000
745,Speaker 2,"And do you remember who the pronouncing Dr. would have been?",2939.000,2942.000
748,Speaker 2,"Like how does how does.",2942.000,2943.000
749,Speaker 1,"That process work process the way it works was person sound with no vital signs. Nurse goes in with the stethoscope. This is for one minute.",2943.000,2953.000
750,Speaker 1,"If there's no heartbeat, no lung sounds. Nurse goes and calls the doctor on call.",2953.000,2959.000
751,Speaker 1,"U.",2959.000,2959.000
752,Speaker 1,"M.",2959.000,2961.000
753,Speaker 1,"There was also a sheet that we had to fill out.",2961.000,2963.000
754,Speaker 1,"If we thought it was a coroner's case.",2963.000,2966.000
755,Speaker 1,"In this case, I don't believe we thought it was.",2966.000,2969.000
756,Speaker 1,"And then.",2969.000,2971.000
757,Speaker 1,"Family is called and the Doctor May wait to come in and pronounce in the morning. Family can come in and visit the body at anytime, so then the PSW's would get the the body ready.",2971.000,2984.000
758,Speaker 2,"OK. So prior to the doctor announce you in the morning, the family could come in and even sign.",2984.000,2987.000
759,Speaker 1,"Yeah. Yeah. So the PSW will just clean them up, put on, you know, clean britches and clean up the.",2987.000,2995.000
760,Speaker 1,"Bed and stuff.",2995.000,2997.000
761,Speaker 2,"So you said you said, Mr. Silcox, you said we didn't think it was a coroner's case.",2997.000,3002.000
762,Speaker 2,"Who wanted that thing?",3002.000,3006.000
763,Speaker 2,"OK.",3006.000,3007.000
764,Speaker 2,"So would that be just a decision that?",3007.000,3010.000
765,Speaker 2,"You are trusting to me.00:50:11 Speaker 1 A. No, there's a there's a form on the computer and you go down through and if it says if you take off anything that says yes.00:50:20 Speaker 1 You notify the coroner.00:50:22 Speaker 2 All right, but you would have clicked off those boxes yourself. Yes. OK. So obviously, knowing that you had done this to Mr. Silcox, did you feel that you wouldn't click? Yes. So that attention would be.00:50:33 Speaker 2 Drawn to you?00:50:34 Speaker 1 You know, I honestly can't.00:50:35 Speaker 1 Remember, if he was clever case or not.00:50:38 Speaker 1 You might have them.00:50:39 Speaker 2 Now with insulin.00:50:40 Speaker 1 I would even though I did this to these people when.00:50:43 Speaker 1 I did there.00:50:45 Speaker 1 But see, it's phrased as. Does anyone have a?00:50:49 Speaker 1 Reason to believe?00:50:50 Speaker 1 That this death was not natural, so yeah.00:50:54 Speaker 1 I would click.00:50:55 Speaker 1 I wouldn't get that one. Yeah, you're right.00:50:58 Speaker 2 OK. And I just wanted to clarify that please.00:51:02 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:51:06 Speaker 2 OK.00:51:09 Speaker 2 Anything else you can think about from R silcox?00:51:14 Speaker 2 Maurice.00:51:17 Speaker 2 Is it that?00:51:19 Speaker 2 So tell me a little bit about Maurice. This says that this occurred in September or October of.00:51:23 Speaker 2 20.00:51:25 2007.00:51:27 Speaker 2 And this was at present.00:51:27 Yes.00:51:28 Speaker 2 Care.00:51:29 Speaker 2 OK, tell me.00:51:29 Speaker 2 A little bit about your interactions with Maurice.00:51:31 Speaker 1 He was another one who'd like to grab restenosis. He was sometimes a patient of mine. See, at that time I wasn't. I didn't have a set for that. I worked on. I worked on all the different floors of the nurse guide was filling in.00:51:45 Speaker 1 So.00:51:49 Speaker 1 He.00:51:51 Speaker 1 One afternoon I was working with him and he.00:51:53 Speaker 1 Did grab me.00:51:54 Speaker 1 And again, I got that feeling inside that this is his time to go.00:52:00 Speaker 1 So I gave him an overdose of insulin after supper, and I believe he died the next day.00:52:07 Speaker 2 And what was your shift that do you remember what shift you working at that point?00:52:09 Speaker 1 It was 3:00 to 11:00.00:52:11 Speaker 2 3:00 PM.00:52:14 Speaker 2 11 year.00:52:14 Speaker 1 So did I. Lee died when I wasn't there.00:52:21 Speaker 2 He was known for it's that you're grabbing this dash breasts and *****.00:52:26 Speaker 1 Yeah.00:52:28 Speaker 2 And do you remember who you would been working with at that point?00:52:31 Speaker 2 Yeah. Do you remember where Maurice was within Crescent care?00:52:37 Speaker 1 Yeah, he was down in the north wing.00:52:40 Speaker 1 I think he was in a in a double room on.00:52:43 Speaker 1 The right hand side.00:52:45 Speaker 2 And you remember whose roommates were done at all?00:52:46 Speaker 1 And then.00:52:48 Speaker 1 No, I don't. But I do remember that when we started going downhill after the insulin overdose.00:52:53 Speaker 1 They moved into the palliative care room right by the nurses.00:53:00 Speaker 2 And at what point of the day do you?00:53:02 Speaker 2 Think that you sorry.00:53:03 Speaker 2 I think you said that. Sorry, but just.00:53:05 Speaker 2 To confirm what what time the.00:53:06 Speaker 2 ADP was when you had injected them with you.00:53:08 Speaker 1 And then injection.00:53:11 Speaker 1 It is afternoon evening 43530.00:53:16 Speaker 2 And and what was his reaction to her?00:53:20 Speaker 1 Again, it was just kind of like, oh, OK.00:53:23 Speaker 1 And it says the doctor wants you to have a vitamin shot.00:53:26 Speaker 1 That's what I usually say.00:53:28 Speaker 2 And was he able to communicate with you? Global could converse.00:53:31 Speaker 1 Is use verbal.00:53:34 Speaker 1 Not totally, but he could say something.00:53:38 Speaker 2 And did he question this vitamin travel?00:53:41 Speaker 1 No.00:53:43 Speaker 2 UM.00:53:46 Speaker 2 And he passed away the next day. Yeah. OK. So being that you weren't there when you passed away, you would have been the one.00:53:53 Speaker 2 Checking the boxes, that's.00:53:55 Speaker 1 Right.00:53:55 Speaker 2 So you know.00:53:58 Speaker 2 By chance, what nurse would have been responsible for?00:54:06 Speaker 2 Did you ever have any concerns that he didn't pass away while you were working and that?00:54:12 Speaker 2 You know, position may arise.00:54:14 Speaker 1 No.00:54:14 Speaker 1 I know I didn't. Well, yes, I did a little bit. I always wondered if they find the site where I gave the shot and.00:54:22 Speaker 1 Something you know, they've they've been an.00:54:25 Speaker 1 Investigation. I always wondered that.00:54:30 Speaker 2 And even though.00:54:30 Speaker 2 It passed through your mind.
