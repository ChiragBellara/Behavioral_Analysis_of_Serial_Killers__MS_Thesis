The homeless people. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. OK. We're not going to be asking questions which retains our listening.Yes. OK, makes sense, yes. OK. Yeah. Yes. Now what I'm about. Say. And I'm giving up.OK.Right. Yeah, being interviewed, it's hard because it takes so long. So I'll do my best. Like if, like I said, if I have to get up and pace around. Yeah. I have no as long as I can. No, no, I didn't. I want to get through this and find out what happened to my mom and dad because I know they're upset because someone went to visit them today and she visited them today and they said, you know, they're here. We're concerned what's going on.Yeah. OK. Yeah. You should have bought boot boot your ticket. For you right there. Yes. Elizabeth Tracy, may Wettlaufer. Name the record TLAUSER. Yes. Yeah, that's right. 2015. Right. Of paper, yes. And registered nurse I started I. Started from with from. Here in Park Secondary school I.Question. I graduated grade 1313 year in law school, not law school. So a journalism school and. Then I went to Bible College and London Baptist Bible College in London, graduated with a degree in counseling with the bachelor's degree in counseling. And then. Discovered that that's not going to be wasn't really going to get me. A. Lot far as work wise and career wise. And so I went back to here in Park High School for a year. And I took a year of maths and sciences and went on to. Conestoga College in. They have it's in Kitchener, but they have staff for campus, so I. Went there for three years.OK. And then when I graduated there. I worked in a place called Geraldton which is 16 hours Mason of Toronto, 3 hours north of Thunder Bay. Yes, work there. Couldn't stand the isolation, moved back, worked for an organization called the Christian Horizons here in town, and one of their group homes. Till 2007. At which time my marriage fell apart in February 2007, and I met a woman online and she decided to move to be with me. So I ended up. Quitting the job of that and going to corrective care to make a little bit more money because I would never burden burner. So I started working at Crescent Care. It was June. 2007. Until. Yeah, till like I. Think it's March 2014? As the red as a registered nurse and registered nurses role is always the same. But. I worked in different areas of the home. There's five wings. To correct some carrots, I worked in different. No, there was. There was one supervisor, Helen Conway. She was ahead there. And then there was, like, people under her. Shelly Jeanette. Then there was like a an administrative head. I think for most of that time. It was Brenda. Yeah, I went from Crescent Care fired from Crescent care, OK. For a medication area era error, then from there I went to Meadow Park nursing home. And left there. Here to give help with an addiction issue health and that it would get help with that as well. And then when it came back, I started working again in January. I left. I left Meadow Park in September of 2014 and I started working for a. Nursing agency called Lifeguard in 2015. And I worked with them. For over a year, and then in July 2016, I started working for Saint Elizabeth Healthcare as well. I was still working for lifeguard. Saint Elizabeth was my priority. So, and lifeguard is very much. You pick up the shifts as they come. Very few scheduled shifts so. Get to know them and focus on family. With the lifeguard, it's an agency, so you go into nursing homes, you go into people's homes, you go into. You go into like retirement homes. We did a lot of different things, a lot. Of one on. Ones with. People like in their own. Homes. 12 hour shifts, 8 hour shifts sitting with them, a lot of stuff I did with sitting with high. Just patient, right. OK. Hey, that's OK. Yeah. Like, because I knew they were going to die, and it was just an opportunity to give the family a. Since when some when someone buying the house families don't want everyone to be asleep at once, right? And that can be very hard if you're not able to do that. But if you have nurse there that says no, it's OK. I've got this. I know the medication to get.Yeah. Hi, mark. I was a binge user so I would use what I could get a hold of by doing it from the patient. There's there's some. There's a lot of medication. Some of them had confusions, so they couldn't tell the difference between what those you were giving them like, given the large difference that item. There was a lot of the times as needed, so it would be in a. Big. Card and they say I would just punch out that. Ohh. Barney needed two of those today and I'll delete even three of those today when they really didn't. And that's how I was gonna hold of it every once in a while. There was also a. Drug, drug big drug holder. Like a safe. Almost that we would put the. Drugs in OK. Once, like if somebody dies and they're like 23 hydro marks left with sizable carbon colder. Well, if you pick it up and turn it upside down and shook it, you get drugs back out of it. Yes. I was. There was a time when Hydromorph was delivered to the home. And it didn't get put away right away. But the person who should have. And so I took the hide remarks and put it in my bag and took it home. And it was who discovered her. And so I just played down. From the police home about it actually done, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, the addiction lasted from being started in 2008 to 2000 and. 14 at which time I went away and got treatment at a treatment center. But then I started using again. Probably since January 2015. No. No, and. I'm going to stop using alcohol as well. I'm going to I have friends in A and I'm I've got a very clear plan thing. If if I'm able to be out and vote or have a very clear plan. And I also know if I'm not able to be able. To vote that. A and their products and others didn't have some problems where they come into prison. No. That's my plan. Yeah. Yeah, just. And just always feeling like I had to be the best possible person and very, very stressful job giving medications to 32 people and making sure. Treatments were done on 32 people carrying presents, 32 people supervising 4P studies, who sometimes didn't always get along and sometimes always didn't always get along with me. It's a hard job and in there it's a hard job and then they would add different things like oh, you have to do this and that to say who's here and counting the medications at the end of the shift. And it was a hard job. And I just, I always was putting this pressure on myself. To be a really. Good nurse and to do everything. Perfectly. And every once in a while. When I give. The whole of the hydra marker to you and take it. Then that pressure was gone, right? I cannot remember. I've tried to try to remember. No, it was. It was at a town that was like. 2. Was a 2 hour drive. No, I have a lock fire near 9. Well, it's a little town outside of Wayland. And they have. It's an 18 day treatment that they have and I was successful. I went through the whole thing. So all 18 days, yeah, OK. And it helps. Yeah, yeah. Son. Yeah, born and raised. And what's not married? From 2000, from 97 to 2007. We broke up. February 2007 no children. I wanted them. They never did. My mom and dad are in their 70s. 75 and 76. I have cousins all over the area and. My brother and his wife and four kids they live in. And they're. Well, it's negative. They're quite active. The oldest one is 26 and he's got a a wife and two kids, he says with his parents. They all live with their parents, except for my. Yeah, this one they have so crazy. I've been to see their house once. They've been here a few times. They came in 2013 for my parents 50th wedding anniversary and my nephew and wife stayed behind and lived with my parents for a few months while my nephew tried to the Bible College. Thanks. They live with the fact. They went back. Younger than you. Older, older. He's three years older than 52.Yeah. Yeah. Yes. It was. That. Is that that's when things get a little crazy. The part that I haven't told the doctors. You're so stupid now. When my ex. And I broke up in 2007. I was already taking the medication for my my borderline personality disorder. And I was so angry. And it was like a voice said inside me. I'll use you. Don't worry about it. And. The different times that. I have caused people's deaths. They caused them discomfort through the through the insulin. I believe it was the influence of that voice or whatever it was. It was in the voice in my head. It was a voice in here. And when I would do it afterwards, I would hear like a lobster in my house. So started working for Saint Elizabeth. And I was doing well, but it was a lot of pressure and the way that you. Know that I've. Help people love to die has been through insulin. And after my first my 30 day. Evaluation. Liar. My supervisor came to me and said, you know, I'm really sorry. We want you for Woodstock but. We have so many. Cancers, schools and in your fall. That need help with their insulin pumps that you're going to? Start working in. In your school and I panicked. I panic. I didn't want to do that. So that you know what they're good, the kids. So about. This one little week after that that I quit. And then I packed my stuff in the car and I drove 2 days into. I drove into Quebec. Thinking like I would just. Start running away, sort of. Thing then I thought no, that's just stupid. I came back. And. That's going to tell my parents what was. Going on that they had. Visitors from Scotland, so I didn't tell them. I just. Sorry, Ben. Two weeks pretending to go to work. When we're here. It's funny, but it's not funny. And then. Once I left, I decided I didn't want to nurse anymore. I didn't want to hurt anybody anymore, so I also cooked my other job. And then I decided. Well, whatever Friday that was that, like I did a lot of looking into how I could get help, but I realized I needed help with whatever this was because part of me had started to believe that it was the devil and part of me thought it might be God with the purpose through my. Life. And I know the doctor asked me those. Questions and didn't answer because I was so shamed. But I just. I didn't want this to keep going on, so I put both jobs. Look into where. I could get help. Doctor Fernando is my psychiatrist. And he's not a very nice man. So. I went on an online support group and was talking on to people on there and they were saying, you know, get some help. So then I started researching some site boards and stuff and I saw candy. And they're the only. Mental health facility in Ontario that has any State department.OK. So I made a decision and I went. I went there on Friday morning. I took the train and off I went and before we went I told the. To Edge told St. People what was going on. My friend from any and. My friend. And told them what was going on and said yes, go and get help. And my friend drove me to the train station. I told them that I told them that I had been killing people and they all said yes. You better go get help and. She's friend from. When I work with. Right. On the. Yeah. Station, yeah. Is my cousin. Yeah, she lives in DC. Friend, my friend. Yeah, OK. I can tell your first name, but otherwise it's confidentiality. That I have been giving didn't say why. Because at that. Point. I felt so stupid. It just helps. So stupid. I know. And it's, you know, it's been a while because I've been doing about like. Do I give the? Names of the people that I killed. Because then here's eight families. They thought that their family member died peacefully and normally and they didn't. And what's that going to do to those families? And even up to going to going to the hospital, I decided I was just going to give the first name and my cousin said let's. They know what years you work there. If you don't tell them the exact name they're going to go in there and go over every single file and that's going to be even worse for the families there. So that she was the one to give me that advice to give the name. No. I told them confidence and they said they promised me they wouldn't tell anyone, but basically the the compliance was if I didn't get help right then, they'll be on the phone the. I told them like I told them the night before I went. That's basically what they said was, you know, if you haven't gotten help Friday, then work on the police. We love you, but we're calling the police. Yes, yes. I'm taking. Fluvoxamine, it's called luvox 200 milligrams. It's anti obsessional and then anti depressant. I'm taking 300 milligrams of Seroquel which is an anti sick of it and they up to that? When I was at Cambridge, which has really helped clear my thinking. Good. And then I'm taking a couple of blood pressure medications and then I've got some. Lots of pains. For when I get really agitated. I took 2 milligrams of Ativan when we left the hospital. Which was you guys know at the time 1:30 or something like. Yeah. And I've had nothing since. Yeah. And he also gave me two lots of. Teams. And was very. I am not to take them until all the interviews are over because they will start to interfere with my thinking. And then that's exactly. Yes, I. Do. Yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. This is pretty. Major, I've only ever had parking tickets. I've never been arrested. Anything is. I understand. Shoulders. Yes, yes, yes. And I've tried to get help. Yeah, I had a pastor that. I told me, prayed over me and told me. I'd. Be fine. And that was God's grace. And then. That was Halloween 2000 and. 13. Yeah. That was here in town. Do you want his name? I'm not sorry it wasn't. Could I just say 2014? With 2013. All right. Yes. That was not. Yes. OK, OK. Long list. Sure we can as. Long as you patient with me. World I'm not. Going anywhere because I'm physically comfortable. It's a nice chair, but. I'm not sure. Hi. Yes. OK. OK. I have written it. I have read it, I have, you know, lived it so yeah. Yes. Yeah. First one that died as resolved.Yeah. Yes. OK. 3:00 PM to 7:00 AM. I didn't see him every time. He wasn't always my patient. I just knew from what people had said that he would grab the the nurses, the grass and bought FedEx and. He would say horribly and. Few things about his life, but now he was there, you know, he was going to suck all this. She was going to **** all with stuff because this would say different things and it just touched me inappropriately once. I'm over. Yes. I I he must have. He wasn't necessarily over. So he was either in a double robber quadruple. He was in the Hidden E Wind S Wind north wind. He was in the north wind, looked halfway down, and he was either in a double bed. Or quadruple bud. He was both his surgery and he had dementia. No, I don't have anything to say. Yeah. Non. Diabetic. Yes. Yes. That I that I tried. Well, there were other people that done it too, who didn't die. Charging him personally, who died, right? Back here, people's agenda. Clotilde Adriana. We. Yeah, yeah.OK.OK. Yes, and I didn't really want her to die. I just. I don't know. I was just. Angry and. Had this sense inside me. That she may be the person that God wanted. Back with him. Yes. Yeah. I told him about the last year methodic, but not the feeling that this might be the person that God wants. I honestly felt like God wanted to use me. And he kept Doctor Khan. Kept asking me if you can go to building for a special purpose. I can say no if that is not that. Yeah. So, but yeah, I just had a sense after my marriage broke up that God has been used me for something. And then after a while, I started to really wonder, after some of the murders, think it was God, or if it was the devil fooling me. No. No. I felt like I was doing what I was supposed to do, but it wasn't what was right for them. Yeah. About 9:30 I gave him a dose of 50 milligrams of insulin. Not not diabetic. So I went into. I used a borrowed insulin pen and borrowed insulin. And gave him his one shot, and at 3:30 the TSA. Well, throughout the night he was yelling out. I love you. And I'm sorry not to not to me, but just you could hear him falling out in this room and that's what he was falling out. And then the 3:30 the TSA's came to me and said that he was gone. So. I did what we're supposed to do. I went listening to his heart and chest. Called the doctor, called the family. So that's what they wanted. Family came in. If that was them for a while. Doctor came in and said that his cause of death was from an embolism due to his post hip. He had he had hip surgery, doctoral, the level of hip surgery. Was young. I love you. I thought it might be his family. They really did. And when they came in and talked to me, they wanted to know if he said anything. Yeah. Yes, I've been there for, yes.Awful. I just want how much better. You know, I felt awful. Maybe I fought with my girlfriend. Did some exercising. You know, there's some using the computer and just try to forget about it. Well, I was working tonight, so I was on the. I would say. I've talked, been turned a bit. Yeah. Sounds pretty bad. And I just want to see the family again. So I tried to make sure I wasn't working when I came to pick up. The stuff and. No, it was down on our phone. And. The insulin was kept in a fridge in the medication room. We had two medication rooms. And some discussed in the fridge in the medication room. And the extra pens are kept in the drawer. So you could just say somebody even had someone admitted you needed a pen. Hurry. They just put it under the pen and. Put the needle on and dial up. The dose and give it. They didn't keep track of him. Yes. Now each patient has their own insulin, right? And maybe somebody noticed somebody may have noticed that a lot of insulin was missing and a lot was used. But I was always careful to using different people. And. I'm not really sure I'm going to say his. Arm or his parts of. No. Oh yeah, he didn't really converse. Team did a lot of yelling at. Don't really remember him reacting when I gave it. I don't remember reacting now.Probably. I would like. Yeah. His wife and daughter loves him a lot. He. Yeah, like I said, it could be a bit of a handful, but you know, he ate and drank normally took his pills when he told him to. So nothing else. I can really remember about him, but this is, you know, nine years ago. Yeah. I broke up with him. Oh, no, no. I woke up with him in. End of January beginning. Of February 2007. Yeah, by that time I was in a new relationship. With a woman. Her name was Maureen. No, absolutely no. Yeah. I don't know. No, no, no, I don't. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah, I just do a lot of. Yeah. Well, that would be Helen Romney. She was always like whoever was on as the. Nurse was the charge nurse. So I was the charge nurse. And at night, so as the charge nurse from 3:00 to 11:00, I was in charge of. 12345678 TSW and I would never. Yeah. And then. There was two other wings, and so at night, as the church nurse, I was responsible to look after the RPM on the other side like view resource server. There were four PSW's on that side and four PSI's on my side. The nine people, and then finally, of course, she wasn't around. Maybe the chief. Her and the executive director, Brenda. I'm sorry. I'm probably gonna. No. I don't know. I wonder if that's a portion of how I chose him afterwards. I did feel a release and a release. Like a release of pressure. Yeah, I'm not. It might be, but I also know I just felt like they were the ones right. They just feeling as though that. They were. 3:00 in the afternoon, thinking about it, about 6:00 at night, I think.No.No. That process work process the way it works was person sound with no vital signs. Nurse goes in with the stethoscope. This is for one minute. If there's no heartbeat, no lung sounds. Nurse goes and calls the doctor on call. U. M. There was also a sheet that we had to fill out. If we thought it was a coroner's case. In this case, I don't believe we thought it was. And then. Family is called and the Doctor May wait to come in and pronounce in the morning. Family can come in and visit the body at anytime, so then the PSW's would get the the body ready. Yeah. Yeah. So the PSW will just clean them up, put on, you know, clean britches and clean up the. Bed and stuff. OK. I tried to stay away from it sometimes I was very interested to see what was happening. I would just try to stay away from it. You know, there were people who loved him. There were people who loved them. He had he had friends that were coming, that were like family. And then the woman says. I just. Well, I wasn't there when he passed away. I didn't work that day. I might have. I know when I found out that he died, I'd love to see how long it took him to figure out the notes and stuff to see what I've got. And it's. Getting a point out to fetch it with. Yeah. No. No. So and even if I had, I've been ultra sensitive, could not. Yes. I think you'll see the. Yeah. How long? I don't remember a lot about. She was very quiet, very determined, just seemed to be waiting to die again. I had that feeling that, you know, this is. The one. And. I made a bit of a fuss about it that night because she was very lucid and we talked about how much she likes blue. Very. High in ice cream. So on my on my break I went to Walmart, I got a small blueberry pie and ice cream and brought it to her and she had. 3 or 4. Like and then that night I overdosed her. Like I said, I had that feeling that. Great time to go and. Know that she was the person to go. Give us. Darian after I did it, I got that lobster. Both. Oh. No. See, I don't know. I don't know. So. No, there is no set amount. Yeah. No, there. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I believe she died that day. 60. From from the same place I would get it. Yes, she was on the South wing. And. Probably about four doors down from the nurses station in a. Double room on the. The right hand side, if you're facing the. End. She is on the right hand side. No, no. She was very quiet. It was just back up that feeling of this, you know, she's next to the time so. Choose. Couldn't tell you her diagnosis, just that she was she didn't get out of bed a lot and she had to be fed her food and. Fed her pills. So she she was near her end and like. Library. I don't think. Once I gave the information there. Kind of laid low and didn't. Yeah. And then you can. Probably her arm. The reaction? Mentor now. I don't know. She was. No. You just, I just kind of. I tried to stay away from it sometimes I was very interested to see what was happening. I would just try to stay away from it. If they were, if they were my. If they were mania charge. Yes, I got you. Yeah. Well, usually they get very diaphoretic red. They could lose consciousness. They shake some people. One person has seizure. Think it was just one person. Two people stroke traders. Not right after, but they stroked, hosed. You can actually three people because they believe James Stroke does as well. So that's just so helpful to have. Yeah. Yes. That's right. But she could talk and communicate a lot. She was. She was feisty. Yeah. Soon here at the nursing home, and she's experience sold novice see and. One night, she said, you know, I'm going to die tonight. Yeah. And I said, oh, and she said, yeah, why don't you get me into the why don't you get me into the deathbed so I can die? Are you sure? That's what we did, that I didn't die. So I said OK and I went to the other nurse. That was working with.Me. And she said, oh, OK, well, let's put him inside his care room, if that's what you. So we did. And then I thought, well, she must be the next one. I had a feeling should be she must. Be the next one. Because she was saying she was going to die. But there's no time. She just gonna die. So I gave her an hour and she became higher. Then she died. Thanks in a couple of days. Hey. Which one has the vodka in it?So. He was down the sampling. Couple of rooms down from the the. Down from the nurses office. And she? Yeah. So we did put her in the pipe in bed. Together we made it. No, no. We had, we have enough autonomy that if we thought someone was paid, if we could call the doctor, tell them what was going on. Moving, move the person to the palliative bed and get orders for positive care. I think she may have been the first person that I did in long acting and short acting 2 together. 211 drops your blood sugar right away. The other starts working through your body and dropping it gradually over. Long periods of time. But it just keeps dropping it. Ah, there's so much I didn't know for sure, but I figured it would be much stronger than just. The short acting. Yeah. I told her. I told her it's her pain. While we had moved her from the double room to the living care room, right catered corner from the nursing home. In Italian. Yeah. So I said, OK, she must be the one. When I gave the info and I got that feeling inside and the laughter. To die? Not like that. No. She's like, I want to die. I want to die. I want to die tonight. I'm going to die. Yeah. Afternoon, 3:00 to 11:00. I am. Might have been after supper, so both 7. No, no, not too funny. I don't think I was. No, no, I didn't live off this record. Maybe fun? But I don't know. Yeah. I am. I kept having a lot of help. A lot of guilt. Mary. Well, as you'll see, after Mary was bodice and after gladice, there was. A period of two years work I. Didn't do it. Three years. I was trying very, very hard to get close to God to make sure that this wasn't him and to just live my life, read the Bible, go to church and not do that. Anyone do it anymore. So I tried very. Hard. I'm still using a little bit more. Yes. Right. Shouldn't say it like that, but I. Yeah. Think it sounds like it. Yeah, right. Brian. Bill is. Yeah. Yeah. Papa Ryan, pop down some water. Yeah. Yeah. Ryan water. Drink. I don't know. If you get it all those shots. I don't do drinks so like 3 * 9. 27. Yes. I never did it with the head remark. One of the other because the business is margin. For when I didn't have the 100 mark. And if I was going out, but I think that with people I was going to mostly by myself and just. At the scratch and win tickets into foods and drinks. Yeah. All the things that you've talked about so far, now peacefully in my. Opinion and I am sorry. I searched for what the families went through at the time and I'm extremely. Sorry for what they're going to do. It's awful. What can you say? To them, that would matter. I'm. I'm sorry isn't enough. I should have gotten help sooner. I just something from you that was precious and speaking too soon. I honestly believe that the time that. God wanted me to do it. But I know now that's not true. And. If I could take it back, if I could get help sooner, I would. Yes. That's what I was hoping to. Take to my grave and don't tell anybody. A long time ago, yeah. It was in 2014, before I. Yes, the Welland cobra. Yes, the rehab center. Spoke to the lawyer and that she was going and told me to get out. I need to go back. Yeah.So. No. OK. Yeah. OK. This. Swings. 3 Doors Down from the main desk in a double room.Yes.And. Oh. Well, when I first started caring for her, she was walking and talking when she. Had quite the. Spirit, she was she was punched a man. Oh. Because she overheard the nurses telling one of the gentlemen. No, you can't push your wife around. You have to come with us. And she turned around. She said you can't treat a woman. Like that. And his the man. So then we're all in a state of trying to keep them from fighting with each other and. Trying to keep. Them from hurting us, right? Yeah. She was very fun, but she went down downhill fast. Eventually she was. She had dementia, didn't take her pills well, didn't eat well. Very stubborn woman and. As always, one evening I just got that. Red surging feeling that she was going to be the one and. Give your insulin over there. No, never. Now it's happening at work. On, yeah, I guess you could say well for the moment, but it was. Is usually they're happening, you know, focused on one patient and then I would feel that road searching, which is what made me think. It was God. The time zone there. Hi. I believe I was working because I've been working nights or days. Because I know it was close to the end of my shift. So they did it, and the person who came on next shift, I think it. Was. Night. So the person who came on next shift checked her all over and started called the doctor and had her made palliative. And. They're they're on the pain pain regimen and. Find out. I I probably at that point, I think it was giving everybody a mic. Yes. Everybody. Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes. No, no, no. No. Well, not whatever you like. But yeah, the insulin, the insulin. Yeah, this one needs to get volume needs get like injectable volume. Yeah, it was fairly. Easy to take meds from there. I believe she died the next afternoon or that afternoon. No, not. Yeah. When someones dying it seems like. It takes longer than it does if you're around, if you know what I mean, yeah. I think I worked two days later. I think I worked the day after her. Death whenever that was. Yeah. Yeah. You know. I would wonder if she had died, I would wonder. You know, if this would be the time, I would get caught. You know, what was I going every time? Every time I walked in after somebody who passed away, I always wondered this is. They are going to get caught.What kind of? Are you? Fired jail. No more nursing license. That's exactly what I'm looking at now, otherwise because my cell phone, instead of being fired but. Jail and no more alert nursing licenses. Probably every time. Yeah, probably every time, yeah. She fought a. Little bit. Yeah. Like she struggled around. So I I kind of thought on her legs that I could do where she couldn't reach me intentionally. Yeah, pinch. Scratch. Per month, yeah. My ambitions, and like even the the PSA's who had to change their product. Sometimes you fight them and scratch them and pinch them and twist their hair and yeah. I don't know. I think some of the. I think some of it did. You know, the stubborn Netflix stuff and. Yeah, just kind of. OK. You're the next one to go again. There was always that red surgeon that I identified with God telling me. This is 1. Yeah, this is how you work for me. Later on, as you'll see. Pretty much as soon as I had time with the rest of my job. There's. 32. Yeah, 32 nurse. Our registered practical nurse registered practical nurse. Oh yes, I definitely can. Now. Yeah, I definitely think that maybe made me made my mind more susceptible to. No. Probably once or twice a week. Yeah, yeah. Your mushroom a number of ways you can get them right. You can sign off that somebody got their sign off, that somebody on the PRM and take it instead, you can. Taking their regular medication, and if they're not able to identify it, take it instead. You can take the regular medication that's in capsule, and if they are able to identify it, open the capsule, take the step out the capsule back together again, give them, and then the castle. Take it yourself. I just followed it. I never shouted. I never started it. Yeah. Of the insulin. I think I gave her 8060. I think. With you he relaxed, and then by the time the next nurse came on, she was red. She was sweating and she was incoherent. She her blood, her vital signs rolled down.Yeah. Because I was just leaving when the next nurse came on and. She. TSW skin to her and she said something going on with clothes and see. She said come with me. We have to go check on clothes. Yeah. So I actually helped you move farther to the highest here. Scared out of my guards the whole time, it was something I did. Able to communicate at that point, no? Karen, I don't mind your last name. If I thought something. How? Yeah. Yeah, I know.OK.Yeah. Yeah. No, no. In November 2011, I came home from a. Cruise of the Caribbean and. I was feeling guilty. I was feeling damned. I was feeling confused. I I feel like I just didn't want to do it anymore. I was feeling like if I could somehow connect with God. Strongly enough that I wouldn't do it anymore. And so I spent a lot of time reading my Bible and praying and deciding I just wasn't going to do it anymore. So. And I had the odd urge to do it, but I resisted by going to church, reading my Bible, praying. And telling God I didn't believe him, that he wanted me. To do it anymore. Yeah. Sometimes, but I did a lot of praying about it and I would. I just did a lot of praying, reading my Bible, getting very involved in my in my face, getting very involved in my church.Right.Yes. No, no, I didn't tell anybody or anything like that. That was, I told him after Helen Young. He was that. Apologize for that. She was on a site that has been transferred to a side, which is the new unit label relatively new than 10. 12 years old. I was on the 1st floor. I was. The charge nurse. To the first floor. And she was. In the room closest to the nursing station. Retirement home there. So all the change your time time to the. To the nursing home. Not fine. That's fine. Easling. And then. Then, then the hallway SE wind is. You have one unit 2 in the building, right? On top of each other. Of it was, it was all single one. Now I'll move it around then. Yeah, it was all anywhere out of the area. Yeah. How was Mr. folk? She recently yellowed, helped me, nurse. She frequently yelled out she wanted to die. She just was not happy with her life. She was wheel wheel around in a wheelchair, saying helping nurse help a nurse help a nurse help a nurse. And when you went to help her, what do you want help with? Like, get away with me. Go away. Helping nurse helping nurse. Didn't want to eat, didn't want. To drink, it's very difficult to deal with. Constantly with yellow and early to say what you want help, but I want to die. Why can't you help me die? I want to die and one night it was like something snapped inside and that red surge came back and I thought, OK, you look like. So. I gave her a shot. I came out to her, said this through your pain and I gave her a shot of long acting. Her short acting and she started to settle down and then later on we put it in her into bed and I gave him more. More. Of the insulin, I think that. Was wrong last time. She had a seizure. She turned red. She was diaphoretic. The PSW's called me to the bedside. I took all of her vital signs, and I pretended to take both sugar. And today is normal. So worry about it. That's here. Don't know. Don't let anybody. See that part of the. No, but what I mean is what I mean by that is TSW nurses, nurses focus on the meds and treatment. TSW is focused on like they were busy. They're busy watching her. They were busy changing her. They're busy dealing with the fact that she was having diarrhea. They were not doing the part of the job I was doing, so they never would have noticed. Where's my burger? So they never would have noticed me not taking the butcher because I took her like I did her call. So I did everything else so they wouldn't have noticed that it didn't do that because. They were busy with everything else. 5.6, she said. Yeah, yeah. Afternoon. I was straight through to 11th at that point and straight through to 11:00 on that ward. That it's starting a little bit before that, yeah. Yes. 1-2 days after. No, it wasn't. No, it was all the payment nursing home. It was all the same. Ballsy. Just that that nursing home was that wing of the nursing home was built to accommodate the fact that the owner took over in our villa, right? So. Everybody from their villa got moved to the new part of the nursing home. So that's the only reason. And then eventually they all mixed together. I felt horrible. I felt angry at myself. I told the salesman as well. I felt like God failed. Neat. I continue going to church, yeah. I did, but I was getting very confused. So it was soon after that that I. Went to the pastor. And told him what had happened and he prayed over me. And because he said that was the last thing he would have thought of me and his wife was there too. And they prayed over me and they said to me that this is God's grace. But if if you ever do this again, we will have to turn you into the police. In their house. I kept going to their church. Oh, I had told. I told him that I was taking people's. Lives. No, no. I don't know if I told them how many people did. But I was doing it. I want. You could put his hands on me. Yes. Do you have nice would love you very much and move there at least twice a week. Before before he died. Yeah, yeah. Let's say in the late 50s, early 60's the 90s. I think it was a day or two after when she was gathering her stuff and she cried on my shoulder. Thank me for. Being a partner. You have at that .0 guilt. Change in your. Like I had betrayed her. And not that I was betrayed, but betrayal. But I betrayed her. I just, you know, gave her husband and said I was so sorry. But on that point that I was getting very confused about was this God and wasn't not. Yes, yes, that is the difference between right and wrong. But I thought this was something that God or whoever wanted me to do it. Starting at that point to doubt that it was God, yeah. The PSW. It would have been students too, I think. But I can't remember. Yes.So. Mine was a handful. Human attack on the patients who would pull their hair, she would hit them, she would pinch them. Eventually, it was decided that she needed a one-on-one staff, so sometimes they would book an extra PSW to be with her. Sometimes someone will come from the outside to be with her. Available. That was nuts. Sorry, that's just absolutely nuts. So. She just got harder and harder to look after and one night when I had had to look after her that. Was like he had like, you know. I'm starting getting the feeling about surge again, is that no, I don't want her to die. But if I could somehow give her. Enough of a. Dose please give her a coma or something to change your brain with. Maybe make her less. You know, maybe make it less mobile. Hard to handle left handle hard to, you know. So yeah, I was the director. Yes, she was right across. She had gone into the room that Helen had been in. Yeah, she's right across from nursing station. Yeah, that night she stroked and severe stroke she went to the hospital, and when she came back to fix her few Sarah was nursing home for a few days and she died. So before she came back from the hospital, I was fired from Crescent Care. For medication errors that had nothing to do with it. Yeah, because they've been some subjects there. And then, yeah, night. But they knew that she was totally vegetative. When she came back. Because they're yeah. No, she had her own room. Competitive care room was for people who didn't have her own room so that families could go and be with them and not, you know, not just serve to their residents and not. Be disturbed by the other residents. A lot. I'm going to say 80. Long accidents, 50 short acting, something like that. There is a lot. Of influence. Why so much? Wasn't sure she would die or not, and they really wanted to make sure that she their mind was changed that before she came after. Yeah. But. Oh, Oh yeah. The first time I gave it to her, she said, hey, what was that for? And I said that's your. That's your vitamin injection. Yeah. Probably an hour and a half. Two hours. Yeah, 8:00 or 9:00 at night. Yeah. She had she had two friends that came. And saw her a. Lot. She had a boyfriend that was coming to see her. 82. Yeah. Basically, no, if they wanted. To come late at night, they had to. Let us know. So we could let them in and then. And that was more propitious with people. But no, there was no. Real restrictions, I mean, there was the odd patient who had a restriction like they can't leave the building with this person or they can't leave the building with that person or so. So she was off call the police. That person. I was not. I've already been fired. Late March, early April. Here, come back and then I. Would like to. Good. Yeah. Yeah. For something that had nothing to do with her. And my timeline may be wrong. It may have been February. Because I know that. And uh by. The middle of April I was working again at Meadow Apartments. I haven't had a few medication errors, and strangely enough, not on her wrist. One of our residents was missing her. Long acting insulin that she got at supper and it was coming from pharmacy, but I wanted to make sure she got her.OK. Insulin. So I took insulin from another person who I thought was the same insulin. But it was short acting and it gave her a seizure because she. Wasn't used to it. And she was she was OK. We we helped her and she was all right. But when they figured it out, I was fired because I had other. Medication errors with love. No, no different things. Eye drop. What met air? The workload? Point you know what? I never made it. I never made. It work. I never made it. Never. Never. Yeah. No. Yeah, searching and yet and then the laughter afterwards, which was really it was like a cackling from the head of health, if that makes sense. Yes, it's been cackling. Same feeling same. Pretty much within a month. I told the person that hired me at Meadow Park. She told me she had found my resume somewhere because I never fly to Meadow Park, but she found my resume somewhere and she called me because I needed a nurse. So when we did, our interview name was Heather. Forget about. And it's not there anymore. When we did our interview, she said to me, why did you leave? And I told her, I said, I'll be absolutely honest with you. I was tired from Metairie. And she said, well, tell me about them. And I did. And she said, OK, well, I believe in second chances. So you're hired full time afternoons and it was a one year contract. I still live in Woodstock in my community best support. Either 630 no. Sorry. Either 2:30 to 10:30 or three. 11. I'm not sure what you look. No different, extremely similar. The only difference was that the RPM would do the if there were dresses that had to be done at night, they do the dressings. The people at night that reminds people. But a little other than that, yeah, and. Heather or yeah.Right. Yeah. Yes. He was mean. He would grab the. Nurses and the. NCSW whenever they were trying to do things for me, he would grab them. He would twist their arms, he would punch them. Very difficult to do care for. And. One night I just got that surgery like that that you need to go. No, not really. Just been his normal self and he thought he thought the first needle. And then. That's so good. Need to worry about him. And I forgot something about Maureen. I had given her a dose of. Whatever we dosed her with to calm her down before I ever gave her the insulin. Forgot about that. But is that in there? And given our sedative, just before I ever gave any. Yeah. Yeah. The art I gave a large amount of short acting, large amount of long acting and between each other and then I when I left for the night he was still OK. When I came back the next day and worked, it said that he had had a stroke. Severe stroke and gone to the hospital. And the nurse that I talked to who's been on the night before, she said to you how low blood sugar was. And I said hello. And she said, oh, like one point something. And then and then she said, you know what? I went home and I did some research. Research. Sometimes having a bad stroke to make your blood sugar go up. Yeah. That's what she said to me. Yeah, that was odd. But yeah, so he lived for a couple of days and. It was a nightmare. Was just short to attain the lady. Injected her. I'm going to say 7:30 and then 9:30. He thought it, yeah, 85. And helped me to really clarify the fact, but no, it wasn't God, it was something wrong with me psychologically that was making me believe that it was God.And. Not much. They asked me what I was doing and I disabled it. Yeah. Iron. And side. It's kind of, but then I need to. Have your medicine. And eventually. No, you didn't throw toilet. Yeah, yeah. Park it may have just been two or three days. And his family was devastated. Absolutely done. Other than other than dementia, he is fairly strong. He's in a wheelchair, but he's a good eater and he's drawn and. I'm going to say maybe 78. He had a son named Art. To understand the comedy. Yeah. Like I I think it's just like a magnet for. And then his his wife. That's all I remember. I know you had other business. There are other family members involved with the.Umm. Well, they came in to take the stuff out of this room. While he was still in the hospital, they came then in the 5th and stuff and then when he was gone they came in to take the rest. Again, they could be trading them. We're back from the I know we're almost done. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I've got the seven times. Alright. We're getting there. I have 714. Yes. Not really. Well, he was a big game hunter and he had pictures at all of this. Yeah. Well, our is a big game hunter. Maurice I don't know, James. I don't know. No, I just never really did. Again, from the from the medication fridge, from using experience new. Why is that? Answer is not something that's usually. Yeah. I mean, I think it is. Now. I have some homes. Track it now. Yeah. 24th and 20. 5th. I was at the the Cambridge. The doctor suggested to me that I should. Not not to give to the police, but he said he says that if I wrote it out, it would be a good part of my therapy. So and did take a large amount of pressure off me. And help me to really clarify the fact, but no, it wasn't God, it was something wrong with me psychologically that was making me believe that it was God. It really helped me to clarify that. Is in my. Knapsack in the back of your car. Yeah. Do you have a stamp that you can stamp? It as the original. OK. OK, Cliff shoes. First person I ever gave extra insulin to. I think I gave her 40 and I just again, there was that surging, but it wasn't so much that I wanted to die. It was more of. Let's see what happened. And I get it sent to her on more than one occasion, albino was. OK. Yeah. Yes. Her room is in the east wing. Second door on the left. And then East swing the first door and left. Was your sister Alvina? She was diabetic. She was October 2007, 2000. Until then, albino our sisters here. Then there was Wayne. He was on the north wings. He was he had dementia. He was diabetic. He could be had cooperative. And I gave them a large overdose. UM. Because I thought it was just turned it off. That was lame, really. Hilda was 90 years old. Albino was probably 8082. Matilda, I think it was her daughters, and Albina was her husband. Sure, not at that point. Oh, wait a second. What would they get at night? It was long acting, so it was what they thought at night. With those two, it was their own insulin. This extra jug, so probably 20 to 30 to 4030 to 40 extra. I'd say 60. He yeah, he had developed mentally developmental challenges as well as dementia, as well as being diabetic. And. Love being handful. And. He wanted to die, so again, that one night I just felt that surging and. But he didn't die. I think he would say it sometime. That you missed going to go where was when? He was in Room 8, which is the main floor down at the end. 888 Now 8-9. As well, yes. That was 2009. It robs you of your body and you still have your mind. You get progressively more agitated. You get progressively more. Psychotic and your new wheelchair and you've got all these movements that you. Can't control. Horrible. He was 54. And again, one night I just felt that searching and I thought now this must be God, because this man is not enjoying his life at all. Though I gave him a large amount of insulin. I think I gave him 90 total. No, no. No, no. No. Yeah. 2016 winter. Yeah, and I was. Sandra, I think she was in her 70s. She was she was down, the wind, straight down from the nursing desk about two doors on the left. And she had three roommates. And her tall. Not very well, she. Didn't walk anymore. She had a good sense of humor. She often said she didn't want to be there. And so one night I came for my I. Think someone over at all. But she survived because the nurses came on. Neck. Went to check on her to do something else and noticed that she was sweating and does her blood sugar and save her. It just didn't. Oh, for Tilda and Davina, they found them to have short bloods. They found them to have low blood sugar, and they gave them substrate it. And when the mice they just survived. Was never found out. Right. Yeah, not that I know this hasn't been. Yeah. No. He even asked me about it. Not if I thought you'd done everything. Diane, I don't remember her last name. Whatever I got called in for, I was actually working for a nursing agency at that time called lifeguard agency, and I was sent to health service lifeguards. No, not as employed by lifeguard, and I would go to tell for and two other. Places as well. Yeah. Yeah, just. I was only with family. This is this like a month. And a half before I quit. Yeah, I was frustrated with my job. Had a huge. Huge workload. Having to learn a lot of new things, just a lot of frustration. The weekend that this happened there I had all, all of the people that I had looked after. Most of them were in Ingersoll. I didn't know any of them, and on the Saturday I went in and I. Was doing my care. And this is really the only one that was pre planned because on Saturday when, as in Karen Beverly, and noticed that she had a pick line which is line the tick medication. Straight to your. And that she was a diabetic. And so the next day, when I went in, I was really frustrated and I could just really feel the surging and the laughing. And I I gave her a huge amount. I gave her, I think it was 183, three doses of 62 to 69. No, because I was wondering if they're fine one to put into your eyes and about us and wondering if they're fine again. And she's arrived. The next day. No, but I was able to check it on my computer because she's seeing every day by a nurse like to go into tablets from work and see. How she goes? Yeah, on their own tables. There are. Yeah. Sandy was probably her leg, but she was a little bit more difficult. No, I don't. I don't remember. Her first name was Beverly. I should probably. I don't know if I could tell you the weekend it was or not. Yeah. Yeah, in a home like. It was no, I don't. Because I'm not sure. If it was Bev or Bev or. Yes. I've never done it before and never looked at it. I had no idea she wanted. She went to sleep fairly quickly and then left, but when I checked the next day to see how she was through the next nurse. There is no change. She won. 6364. She was diabetic and she had large ulcers on her leg. And she also had a. Severe infection.Doctor. I've done the right thing. Yes. And now I know that it wasn't God. And I'm ashamed of myself that that happens. But I also think that it was mental health. Yeah. I'd like to look files in. My right mind. Or I would have been able to tell. Them. And who I was raised to believe in God, I was raised from my baby to the to Sunday school. So how could? I get such a strong feeling. That this is what goes wrong is unless it was something wrong with my head. If there was ever anything I could do so that nobody did this again, I'd do it. That, yeah, but. Yeah, it was always reported in charge of them.Yes. No. Best part of working in the. Nursing home that this what? They do, might even be your fault there. This is Tom Lang, yeah. No. Think about what, four years ago, when do all. The money to move back. We were only together for a year. Yeah. You had two kids. Yeah. Yes. Have you? Yeah. No, absolutely not. Where it's in right? What would you say tonight? And stay with me. The very first. Person I ever disclosed it to was another girlfriend at the time her name was. That was after I cooked a couple of people and. She told me not to do it again, that she. Was going to. Turn me into the police. In 2008, I think. And then 2011. When I decided to stop killing my friend. I told her what I've been doing and that I had stopped. And then. I told my pastor. And then after that, I told the in two. 1014. After I passed away, I went on a holiday and. That's when I really decided that this had stopped, and so I told. A friend and heredity. Then. I told when I came back I got a good to the lawyer. And then while I was in the Toronto, it was in Cam H. Well, I told my friend before everyone I've told my cousin. I told my friend. And I told my friend. And then while I was in campaign, which I told them someone who I thought was a friend. They turned around and called the police to make sure that it has really been dealt with. And I understand that he thought he was doing the right thing. I understand that. But he had said I won't tell anybody. And as you didn't him as a resource for support and he turned around when I was when? I had already you. Know I'd already shared it, so why would he call the police? Maybe they didn't believe me. I don't know. Maybe they just thought maybe they thought it was June. March. Something that the patient wanted done. I I would say. Yeah. Yes, it is very normal. It's the worst thing. It. Yeah, I hear you. Once in a while I draw I journaled on it and it might. There might be some in my home, but I don't know. I think it should, if if it's around it will be in like a viral binder. In either my desk, my other desk. For my for my. Which we'll call it.Come on. The file files folders in the Yes filing cabinet. You know. Yes, I did. Yeah. Did you want someone to come with me or not? OK. You might not have. I might not have had them. And then at the very end of my coffee table, there's a box and got pictures and a photo of the minutes. There might be something in there too, of a trailer queue. Good evening. Writing path. You document. That's what I've done. Have that I felt. When it happened, just trying to figure out what was going on. In my head. Yeah. I thought I got rid of them all, but I don't know if I did for sure. There would be. I accessed the computer support group for. Borderline personality disorder. It would be on that. It would be on that website. Yes. I couldn't tell you, but I could find you. On my computer. A question. Yep. Yeah. What's your tattoo? Hopefully. Then I have. Hopes for the future and dreams of the future. That somehow some way I can help somebody. There's got to be somebody wherever I go. Jail penitentiary. There's got to be somebody I can help. Maybe somebody who can't read. Maybe somebody who can't write. Maybe somebody has done more than me and feels like it will never be. Forgiven. Maybe somebody who's done listen me, who feels. Like it will never be forgiven. There's got to be something that can come from this. Maybe somebody can study me and come up with answers and new medication. So this doesn't happen again. That's metal. Yeah. Sheldon child molestation. Absolutely. To work with them, I was afraid that that they might get that feeling of wanting to give them into one wanted Joseph specially since they were that diabetic and I just I panicked and there was no way absolutely not open to that. No. I think I did. What happens now? Oh, OK, I might not be going. Home then. OK. Yeah. Yeah, sure. There's some stuff in there too that it is with the nurse. Like it's called the chain link thing. So you start. At what you did and you go backwards to how you're feeling, what you could have done different and all that. Yeah, not. And an increase in medication, which I feel I needed. All right. I'd like to go home. Ian have running. I'd like to. Yeah. You can imagine that things of this nature take some time and I appreciate your patience with me. Yeah. Understand. Thank you. So I have 8:02. OK. OK. Great. Great. OK. OK. I like guns. No, no, no. I used to. I had a 22. Not that I know of. But my. My husband had a gun that his dad gave me that we would shoot with so I could stay at the at the. I could stay at the gun close and shoot and when we broke up, I did the paperwork to give the bathroom. That might be. What they found. OK. No, Sir, no, never will be. All right. You know what? I have to go now. Yeah, I'm gonna go well. You know, it had been sitting down the computer, remember? And even the funds supporters. Might not even have been Lenovo. Can't remember. Yeah. Although there is more than. There was Telfer place. That was the very first. Then there was.Oh. Yeah, the one here southford place. Fort Dover, Dover Cliff. What it was called. I did one piece. We shifted a place in New Hamburg. But I can tell you the name of it. Also, I worked at. Ah. Tougher place and Dover cliffs are both owned by the same people and they have another nursing home in Branford. But I can't remember the name of it. And then and then Park Lane Terrace in Paris. Computer. And Hardy terrace. I think it's outside of her. Ohh and what was the other one called? Oh Lord. It's Weaver and towns like Marin Half Drive from here. My dad grew up in that area. Like it's in the Jarvis area, Jarvis and color area so. I didn't tell you and to remember and shot through the night. Yeah. Is my health going to be a mess? When? I get back OK. So. Yeah, yeah. Oh, then I was. Going to be working with the kids, yes. That's you're telling. My cousin. I love you. Yeah. The lawyer. His name? I cannot remember. Yeah. Yeah. She was a friend from the nursing home. From from present here. I told her after I had stopped the first time. And she felt being my friend. And. 2000 ODST. No. Yeah. She lives in Toronto. OK.Going. Forward from here I want to go home. I want to have a good night's sleep. I want to spend Thanksgiving weekend with my family and they want to be available to the police and intend to meet me. And if I have to come back for trial, I have to come back for. I have no plans of leaving. I can turn to my car if. You want me to? Very, very, very close. I have to tell them tonight what's happened. Yes, they know that. They know that I've been in. They know that I've been in the hospital but. That I just told them it was for treatment, but yeah, I planned today just to go and talk to them. one-on-one, like face to face and tell them they're going to be devastated. I'm gonna. I'm gonna plan on staying. Staying the night there so they have access. To me. Eventually all the support I need. I also plan to go to my AA groups I had planned on doing 90 meetings in 90 days.
